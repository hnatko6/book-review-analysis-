Poetry By Individual Poets,"The crypt of Wawel Cathedral in Kraków is the Polish nation's greatest pantheon. Here lie the earthly remains of its storied kings and queens, and two of its greatest poets, Adam Mickiewicz and Juliusz Slowacki. At the conclusion of his speech at Slowacki's reburial in 1927, Marshal Józef Pilsudski commanded the guard of honour: ""In the name of the Republic, I direct you, gentlemen, to carry this sarcophagus into the royal crypt, for he who rests within was no less a king."" Slowacki, who once described himself and Mickiewicz as ""two gods, on their own, opposing, suns"" has rested alongside his great rival now for over ninety years. Although generally regarded as an eternal second to the national bard Mickiewicz, Slowacki is a great poet in his own right. Had Mickiewicz, who undoubtedly influenced him, never existed, Juliusz Slowacki would still have become an important European poet -- especially as far as drama is concerned. The recognised creator of the modern traditions of Polish playwriting, Slowacki holds a position second to none in the creation of original plays in the style of Shakespeare -- that darling of the European Romantics -- whom many poets of Europe emulated and imitated, while never reaching the facility with the Shakespearean idiom achieved by Slowacki. What is even more striking is the fact that Slowacki achieved this high level of quality at a very early age. The dramas in Glagoslav's edition of Four Plays include some of the poet's greatest dramatic works, all written before age twenty-five: Mary Stuart, Balladyna and Horsztyński weave carefully crafted motifs from King Lear, Macbeth, Hamlet and A Midsummer Night's Dream in astoundingly original works, and Kordian -- Slowacki's riposte to Mickiewicz's Forefathers' Eve, constitutes the final word in the revolutionary period of Polish Romanticism. Translated into English by Charles S. Kraszewski, the Four Plays of Juliusz Slowacki will be of interest to aficionados of Polish Romanticism, Shakespeare, and theatre in general.",en,5.0,"Four Plays : Mary Stuart, Kordian, Balladyna, Horsztyński",True,2027

European History,"The Franco-Austrian War of 1809 was Napoleon's last victorious war. He would win many battles in his future campaigns, but never again would one of Europe's great powers lie broken at his feet. In this respect 1809 represents a high point of the First Empire yet at the same time Napoleon's armies were declining in quality and he was beginning to display the corrosive flaws that contributed to his downfall five years later. In this volume Gill tackles the political background to the war and the opening battles of Abensberg, Eggmuhl and Regensberg. He explores the motivations that prompted Austria to launch an offensive against France while Napoleon and many of his veterans were distracted in Spain. Though surprised by the timing of the Austrian attack on the 10th April, the French Emperor completely reversed a dire strategic situation with stunning blows that he called his 'most brilliant and most skilful manoeuvres'.

European History,"With this third volume John Gill brings to a close his magisterial study of the war between Napoleonic France and Habsburg Austria. The account begins with both armies recuperating on the banks of the Danube. As they rest, important action was taking place elsewhere: Eugene won a crucial victory over Johann on the anniversary of Marengo, Prince Poniatowski's Poles outflanked another Austrian archduke along the Vistula, and Marmont drove an Austrian force out of Dalmatia to join Napoleon at Vienna. These campaigns set the stage for the titanic Battle of Wagram. Second only in scale to the slaughter at Leipzig in 1813, Wagram saw more than 320,000 men and 900 guns locked in two days of fury that ended with an Austrian retreat. The defeat, however, was not complete: Napoleon had to force another engagement before Charles would accept a ceasefire. The battle at Znaim, its true importance often not acknowledged, brought an extended armistice that ended with a peace treaty signed in Vienna.  Gill uses an impressive array of sources in an engaging narrative covering both the politics of emperors and the privations and hardship common soldiers suffered in battle.",en,4.32,"1809 Thunder on the Danube: Napoleon's Defeat of the Hapsburgs, Volume III",True,1173
European History,"In the second volume of this epic work, John H. Gill traces Napoleon's progress as he sought to complete his victory over the Habsburgs. The war had erupted on April 10th with Austria's invasion of Germany and Italy. After just two weeks, Napoleon had battered the Habsburg Archduke Charles in a series of bruising defeats.  This volume begins with Napoleon astride the Danube at Regensburg. He faced a critical strategic choice  -  whether to pursue the injured Austrian main army into Bohemia or march directly for Vienna, the seat of Habsburg power. After electing to target Vienna, his troops defeated the Austrians in the brutal Battle of Ebelsberg, allowing him to enter the city on May 13th. However on the far side of the Danube, he then suffered a dramatic loss at the gruelling, two-day Battle of Aspern. While his Danube forces recovered from this setback, the Emperor cleared trouble from his strategic flanks.  Gill describes in vivid detail the hopeful Habsburg invasion of Italy, led by the 27-year-old Archduke Johann, and the fierce French counter-offensive under Napoleon's stepson, Eugene de Beauharnais (also aged 27).",en,4.49,"1809 Thunder on the Danube: Napoleon's Defeat of the Hapsburgs, Volume II",True,1138

History Of The Americas,"After suffering the hardships and horrors of the First World War, workers and soldiers faced the agony of the post-war Canadian economy. With rising inflation, unprecedented unemployment, and an increasingly repressive state, the atmosphere was ripe for revolt. The Russian Czar had been overthrown just eighteen months ago and workers had revolution on their minds.

Reference Works,"Written by the author of the Maneuver Warfare Handbook and an active-duty USMC officer with experience in Iraq, 4th Generation Warfare Handbook is the doctrine for a new generation of war. Over the last 40 years, the world has gradually entered into a post-Clausewitzian state where the wars are undeclared, the battlefields can be anywhere, the uniforms are optional, and the combatants as well as the targets are often ""civilian"". Conventional militaries have repeatedly attempted to utilize technology to meet the new challenges posed, but even the most advanced technology has provided little more than meaningless short-term victories rendered futile in months, if not weeks. This inability of Western governments and militaries to come to terms with the changing nature of modern warfare has led to failed interventions, failed occupations, and now even failed states everywhere from Eastern Europe to Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. And with the recent mass movement of peoples around the world, 4th Generation Warfare can be safely expected to appear in Western Europe and the United States before long. Drawing on their decades of experience with military history and military action, the authors have distilled 4GW theory into a short, concise, easily accessible handbook that provides the soldier, the military analyst, and the civilian observer with a guide to understanding and responding to the changing realities of this challenging new form of war.",en,4.11,4th Generation Warfare Handbook,True,1467

Poetry By Individual Poets,"All  three-dimensional objects can be experienced in two dimensions: it just  takes some careful unpicking of the seams. Witty, comic, plaintive,  touching, acerbic, droll, cavalier, caffeinated, irreverent, stringent: Austerities,  the mind-altering substantial debut from Sam Riviere, seems to achieve  the impossible in being all things at once. Initially conceived as a  response to the 'austerity measures' implemented by the coalition  government in 2011, the poems quickly began taking on a life in kind:  'cutting' themselves on levels of sentiment, structure and even subject  matter. Not content to merely build a series of freethinking poems,  these remarkable pieces seem eagerly and mischievously to analyze their  moment of creation, then weigh their worth, then consign their excess to  the recycling bin thereafter. Experience is speedy, the poems seem to  say, so dizzyingly fast that the poetry will inevitably be running to  catch up - often arriving at a scene the moment after the moment has  gone. The effect is as funny and it is startling, beguiling as it is  surprising, and makes Austerities a vivid reminder that deprivation, as Leonard Cohen put it, can be the mother of poetry.",en,3.56,81 Austerities,True,1206

Following their example, and drawing on the expertise of emigre Russian-Jewish scientists, the US Department of Agriculture introduced more plants, agricultural sciences, especially soil science; and methods of planting trees to shelter the land from the wind. By the 1930s, many of the grain varieties in the Great Plains had been imported from the steppes. The fertile soil was classified using the Russian term 'chernozem'. The US Forest Service was planting shelterbelts using techniques pioneered in the steppes. And, tumbling across the plains was an invasive weed from the steppes: tumbleweed.

Thousands of men, women, and children spent the war years sequestered in this top-secret military facility. They lied to friends and family about where they were going and what they were doing and then disappeared into the desert. The women came despite the Army's initial objections, as Oppenheimer insisted that would be the only way to recruit the world-class physicists and keep them reasonably sane and content during the years it would take to create this revolutionary new weapon. Conant shows how the stringent security, lack of privacy, spartan living conditions, and loneliness of the isolated mountain hideaway drove some residents to the brink of despair. Yet only a handful gave up and left. Through the eyes of a young Santa Fe widow who was one of Oppenheimer's first recruits, we see how, for all his flaws, he developed into an inspiring leader and motivated all those involved in the Los Alamos project to make a supreme effort and achieve the unthinkable.",en,4.04,109 East Palace : Robert Oppenheimer and the Secret City of Los Alamos,True,1211

Lindenberg's billowing, I-contain-multitudes style lays bare the poet's sadnesses, joys, and longings in poems that are lyric and narrative, at once plainspoken and musically elaborate. Regarding her role in Arnold's story, Lindenberg writes with clear-eyed humility and endearing dignity: ""The girl with the ink-stained teeth / knows she's famous / in a tiny, tragic way. / She's not / daft, after all."" And then later, playfully, of her travels in Italy with the poet, her lover: ""The carabinieri / wanted to know if there were bears / in our part of America. Yes, we said, / many bears. Man-eating bears? Yes, of course, / many man-eating bears."" Every poem in this collection bursts with humor, pathos, verve--and an utterly unique, soulful voice.

Organs, hormones, toxins, lesions: what is a body? In 3 Summers, Lisa Robertson takes up her earlier concerns with form and literary precedent, and turns toward the timeliness of embodiment. What is form's time? Here the form of life called a poem speaks with the body's mortality, its thickness, its play. The 10 poem-sequences in 3 Summers inflect a history of textual voices -- Lucretius, Marx, Aby Warburg, Deleuze, the Sogdian Sutras -- in a lyricism that insists on analysis and revolt, as well as the pleasures of description. The poet explores the mysterious oddness of the body, its languor and persistence, to test how it shapes the materiality of thinking, which includes rivers and forests. But in these poems' landscapes, the time of nature is inherently political. Now only time is wild, and only time -- embodied here in Lisa Robertson's forceful cadences -- can tell.

In these prose poems, Gumbs channels the voices of her ancestors, including whales, coral, and oceanic bacteria, to tell stories of diaspora, indigeneity, migration, blackness, genius, mothering, grief, and harm. Tracing the origins of colonialism, genocide, and slavery as they converge in Black feminist practice, Gumbs explores the potential for the poetic and narrative undoing of the knowledge that underpins the concept of Western humanity.

Rhythmically propulsive and dizzyingly inter-connective, Gamble's new work is as formally adventurous as it is conceptually distinctive, stretching syntax, jumbling the solid and spectral, crossing borders of time and space.

Some of his poems are so simple that they are almost child-like; some are cruel and harsh, while others border on pornography. One can easily call him a wordsmith - he uses words as thoughts to convey his every written nuance. Sometimes, he purposefully chooses archaic and totally obsolete Czech words, which are virtually untranslatable. He was obsessed with women and sex, as well as his belief in God, Satan, Hell and Heaven. Both his sensuality and spirituality appear in most of his works and his intensity of emotion is almost tangible. Yet, he was so sentimental that he saw romance in every situation - even a glimpse of a woman's face in a passing train or encountering a woman in an elevator, or wondering what book that girl in a tram was reading. When the Communist Party took over Czechoslovakia, Holan was utterly devastated by their totalitarian regime, but his polemic was but a grain of sand in the oyster of hope.

From thence follows the distinction between the liberal arts which pursue such noble goods and the mechanical arts which are only instrumental.

European History,"The Science of Walking recounts the story of the growing interest and investment of Western scholars, physicians, and writers in the scientific study of an activity that seems utterly trivial in its everyday performance yet essential to our human nature: walking. Most people see walking as a natural and unremarkable activity of daily life, yet the mechanism has long puzzled scientists and doctors, who considered it an elusive, recalcitrant, and even mysterious act. In The Science of Walking, Andreas Mayer provides a history of investigations of the human gait that emerged at the intersection of a variety of disciplines, including physiology, neurology, orthopedic surgery, anthropology, and psychiatry.  Looking back at more than a century of locomotion research, Mayer charts, for the first time, the rise of scientific endeavors to control and codify locomotion and analyzes their social, political, and aesthetic ramifications throughout the long nineteenth century. In an engaging narrative that weaves together science and history, Mayer sets the work of the most important representatives of the physiology of locomotion--including Wilhelm and Eduard Weber and Etienne-Jules Marey--in their proper medical, political, and artistic contexts. In tracing the effects of locomotion studies across other cultural domains, Mayer reframes the history of the science of walking and gives us a deeper understanding of human movement.",en,,The Science of Walking : Investigations Into Locomotion in the Long Nineteenth Century,False,1438

Autobiographical detail abounds: McDonald's experiences (as a workingclass boy in Belfast, who dreams of leaving, and a middleaged Oxford don, who dreams of going back) are filtered through a deep instinct for poetic tradition. At the heart of the book are two sequences: one, 'Mud', in which family, professional, and literary histories are combined in strictly formal, but personally unguarded, reflections on poetry, class, and privilege; and another, 'Blindness', where a series of tenline units test poetic form to (and beyond) breaking-point, in a meditation on family and suffering, disappointment and hope.

Poetry By Individual Poets,"Although the troubadours flourished at the height of the Middle Ages in southern France, their songs of romantic love, with pleasing melodies and intricate stanzaic patterns, have inspired poets and songwriters ever since, from Dante to Chaucer, from Renaissance sonneteers to the Romantics, and from Verlaine and Rimbaud to modern rock lyricists.

Poetry By Individual Poets,"ABOUT THIS EDITION:  With exception of the titles of the different parts - which were added, for better navigation, from later editions - this edition presents an authentic reproduction of the original 1855 first edition of 'Leaves of Grass' by Walt Whitman. Taking into account that Whitman did much of the typesetting for the first edition himself, the editors of this reproduction, paid special attention not only to text itself but also to an authentic reproduction of pagination, paragraphing and linebreaks.  LEAVES OF GRASS is a poetry collection by the American poet Walt Whitman (1819-1892). Though the first edition was published in 1855, Whitman spent most of his professional life writing and re-writing LEAVES OF GRASS, revising it multiple times until his death. This resulted in vastly different editions over four decades-the first a small book of twelve poems and the last a compilation of over 400 poems. LEAVES OF GRASS has its genesis in an essay called The Poet by Ralph Waldo Emerson, published in 1844, which expressed the need for the United States to have its own new and unique poet to write about the new country's virtues and vices. Whitman, reading the essay, consciously set out to answer Emerson's call as he began work on the first edition of LEAVES OF GRASS. Whitman, however, downplayed Emerson's influence, stating, ""I was simmering, simmering, simmering; Emerson brought me to a boil."" On May 15, 1855, Whitman registered the title LEAVES OF GRASS with the clerk of the United States District Court, Southern District of New Jersey, and received its copyright. The first edition was published in Brooklyn at the printing shop of two Scottish immigrants, James and Andrew Rome, whom Whitman had known since the 1840s, on July 4, 1855. Whitman paid for and did much of the typesetting for the first edition himself. The book did not include the author's name, instead offering an engraving by Samuel Hollyer depicting Whitman in work clothes and a jaunty hat, arms at his side. Early advertisements for the first edition appealed to ""lovers of literary curiosities"" as an oddity. Sales on the book were few but Whitman was not discouraged. The poems of LEAVES OF GRASS are loosely connected and each represents Whitman's celebration of his philosophy of life and humanity. This book is notable for its discussion of delight in sensual pleasures during a time when such candid displays were considered immoral. Where much previous poetry, especially English, relied on symbolism, allegory, and meditation on the religious and spiritual, LEAVES OF GRASS (particularly the first edition) exalted the body and the material world. Influenced by Ralph Waldo Emerson and the Transcendentalist movement, itself an offshoot of Romanticism, Whitman's poetry praises nature and the individual human's role in it. However, much like Emerson, Whitman does not diminish the role of the mind or the spirit; rather, he elevates the human form and the human mind, deeming both worthy of poetic praise.",en,4.12,Leaves of Grass (Wisehouse Classics - Authentic Reproduction of the 1855 First Edition),True,3018

It was only twenty kilometers south of Taochang Temple, where he earlier served as deputy abbot. Its pagoda would have been visible on a clear day�and it still is. Just below the 450-meter summit of Hsiamushan, Stonehouse built a hut and lived there for twenty years. Despite his relative isolation, Stonehouse attracted students, and eventually they convinced him to come down the mountain. In 1331, he was invited to become abbot of Fuyuan Monastery. It was in Tanghu over a hundred kilometers to the east, but he reluctantly agreed. Finally, after eight years, he decided he had had enough of monastic life. He returned to Hsiamushan and lived there until his death in 1352. A few years before he died, he was asked to write down his impressions of mountain life. The result was a collection he called Mountain Poems. Around the same time, his disciple Chih-jou put together a second volume. These were poems Stonehouse wrote for visitors, mostly Zen monks seeking instruction.

Poetry By Individual Poets,"In his fourth collection, 13th Balloon,  Mark Bibbins turns his candid eye to the American AIDS crisis. With quiet consideration and dark wit, Bibbins addresses the majority of his poems to Mark Crast, his friend and lover who died from AIDS at the early age of 25. Every broken line and startling linguistic turn grapples with the genre of elegy: what does it mean to experience personal loss, Bibbins seems to ask, amidst a greater societal tragedy? The answer is blurred-- amongst unforeseen disease, intolerance, and the intimate consequences of mismanaged power. Perhaps the most unanswerable question arrives when Bibbins writes, ""For me elegy/ is like a Ouija planchette/ something I can barely touch/ as I try to make it/ say what I want it to say."" And while we are still searching for the words that might begin an answer, Bibbins helps us understand that there is endless value in continuing--through both joy and grief--to wonder.",en,4.71,13th Balloon,True,942

Wide slumber for lepidopterists is a poetic fantasia, a disorienting yet compelling dreamscape of butterflies and caterpillars and killing jars, where the waking mind's prose transforms into the sleeper's poetry. Each poem unfolds with precision, tracking the stages of sleep and pairing them with the life cycle of Lepidopterae. Insomnia is mirrored in the birth of the egg, narcolepsy in larval hatching. And when the caterpillar starts its final moult, dreams begin, weaving around us as tightly as a cocoon until we are somnambulant, a chrysalis ready to emerge as a moth.  Reading the act of sleep through pupae and moths seems incongruous, but from this unlikely premise comes a darkly erotic text that takes cues from the scientific fascination of Christopher Dewdney, the linguistic experimentation of Gertrude Stein and the aural environments of Bjork to explore science, sexuality and language in equal parts.",en,4.38,Wide Slumber for Lepidopterists,True,962

To this day, his posters hang on the streets of Jerusalem and other Palestinian cities, where key chains are sold with his picture on them. Sections of the poem have even become ring-tones blaring out from cell phones across the Arab world, and children compete in memorizing and reciting it.

It ranges across the history of 20th century England and Canada as she uncovers the life of her father, Jim Neat (b. 1904). She adopts a legal structure, making 'the case' for the worth of Jim's life. Jim leaves England at an early age, as a seaman. He travels to South Africa, stows away to Australia and eventually lands in Canada at the time of the Great Depression. He meets his partner Lizbietta at a bookshop in Saskatoon, but is working in Regina when she dies in childbirth. As a result, Jim becomes both ill and destitute, and is admitted to a hospital in Ontario. His story is told at this point through the hospital's case-notes, his own therapeutic writing and his doctor's correspondence with his sister Queenie, in England. Repatriated to England Jim meets the author's mother during the war. Theirs is a stormy marriage, and at this point she too contributes to the narration. Although they have children and live together until Jim dies in 1983, Jim's life is dominated by the loss of Lizbietta and their child, and the book circles back to Canada and the past as the author uncovers the events surrounding that relationship. Jim Neat is a remarkable evocation of a seemingly fractured life. Although short and drawing on diverse documents Oliver is able to invest an enormous amount of emotion in Jim's relationships, including that with her. The narrative has a certain exoticism - hobos in Canada, a pet fox, extreme weather and its results - but also a casual brutality in the way it recounts lives at the mercy of indifferent forces.

However the book has its imaginative origins in a huge collection of broken household china amassed by the author while digging her garden. Stranger items also came to light: a minute horseshoe, a fossilised scallop shell, a rusted metal silhouette of a hound. These worn shards and talismans soon began work on Freud's singular imagination, and this extraordinary collection of poetry and art is the result. The Remains is concerned with what is left when everything seems broken or lost - and the new and unexpected things that happen when they are found again.

Born into an apparently conventional middle-class family that was in reality deeply disturbed, the poet finally emerged: transforming himself from the neurotic, Oedipal young scientist, through a process of mental breakdown, insulin coma therapy, erotic revelation and the discovery of poetic companionship at Cambridge - and particularly his friendship and rivalry with Ted Hughes.

Poetry By Individual Poets,"Poetry. Asian & Asian American Studies. Moving through past, present and future, this is a family history that journeys between America, Pakistan, modern Europe and even into space. Faisal Mohyuddin delves into the past of his parents and their neighbours in Pakistan and India in a self-consciously impossible attempt to find some way of belonging to a place that is lost. Moving from elegant ghazals of lament to stuttering, disjointed phrases of yearning, Mohyuddin portrays with restrained emotion the complexities of what it is to be displaced, geographically, spiritually, psychologically. With moments of sorrow interspersed with unsettling humour, deep familial love and celebrations of beauty, it is a story recognizable to any who have felt displaced in a new world. If the personal is political, then this is truly poetry for our times.  ""THE DISPLACED CHILDREN OF DISPLACED CHILDREN demands your attention from its title, which speaks directly to a specific immigrant reflexivity, the way the seam of placelessness both separates and connects generations. In one poem the speaker 'forgets the Urdu / word for loneliness, forgets the Punjabi word for / loneliness, forgets the English word for loneliness.' In another, he finds himself 'holding two large rocks, // looking for something else / sacred to smash open.' These aren't hopeless poems, but they have known hopelessness. What a marvel it is then, this work (and it is work) to turn back toward joy, to create joy despite (or to spite) those forces that would conspire against it. Here, starlight travels centuries just to dazzle us. The son of a father becomes the father of a son. Eternity exists only in mirrors, the book says, then demonstrates. I am such an eager student of this book, this poet, and this light.""--Kaveh Akbar  ""Faisal Mohyuddin's debut collection speaks to the desire to forge a wholeness in a world that seems, too often, to be splitting at the seams. Written with an abiding sense of empathy, and charged with an unmistakable longing, these poems dissolve the boundaries between historical record, memory, and the imagination. Mohyuddin memorialises the suffering of the displaced, while at the same time transforming grief into song, heartache into story, and hunger into wisdom. This collection wrung out my tired heart.""--Colum McCann  ""In these poems, Faisal Mohyuddin assembles a lyrical narrative using historical fact and ethereal longing as material a longing that sprouts from, or settles into, the unlikeliest crevices of the historical-personal. For every gash on the map of partition, there is a gap closing between ceramic tiles affixed on the floor by a mother as she speaks of staying close; for every good king, there is an assassin by the same name; for every assassin, a poet; and for every loss, a legend. What I admire the most in this work is how it confronts and diminishes hubris and elevates the quality of desire to echo the idiom of the mystic 'a longing with an energy and weight all its own, a longing that resides in song or sigh, in prayer or embrace, in caw / or coo.'""--Shadab Zeest Hashmi",en,4.6,The Displaced Children Of Displaced Children,True,3115

In The Present Hour, Bonnefoy's latest collection, a personal narrative surfaces in splinters and shards. Every word from Bonnefoy is multifaceted, like the fragmented figures seen from different angles in cubist painting--as befits a poet who has written extensively about artists such as Goya, Picasso, Braque, and Gris. Throughout this moving collection, Bonnefoy's poems echo each other, returning to and elaborating upon key images, thoughts, feelings, and people. Intriguing and enigmatic, this mixture of sonnet sequences and prose poems--or, as Bonnefoy sees them, ""dream texts""--move from his meditations on friendship and friends like Jorge Luis Borges to a long, discursive work in free verse that is a self-reflection on his thought and process.

His Epithalamion (1595) is the most admired of its type in the English language. It was written for his wedding to his young bride, Elizabeth Boyle. Through his poetry he hoped to secure a place at court, which he visited in Walter Raleigh's company to deliver The Faerie Queene. However, he boldly antagonized the queen's principal secretary, Lord Burghley, and all he received in recognition of his work was a pension in 1591.

HAFEZ: TRANSLATIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THE GHAZALS (Miami University Press, 2014), also translated by Geoffrey Squires, won the 2014 Lois Roth Persian Translation Prize awarded by the American Institute of Iranian Studies. In this volume of translations of another of the major figures of Persian poetry, Squires brings the same combination of poetic skill and scholarly precision to the task. The book traces the changing and sometimes challenging relationship between the scholarly Rumi and the unpredictable dervish Shams, who suddenly appeared in his life, and through it the deepening of Rumi's experience of love and his insight into mysticism. We also get occasional glimpses of Rumi the man and a sense of the times in which he lived. There are detailed notes on the poems and a groundbreaking discussion of Text and Context. ""The massive volume of Rumi's DIVAN-E SHAMS resembles a vast field of wild flora in which the person in search of flowers to make a bouquet can easily become confused and lost.

Poems written between 1900 and 1954, by a lyric poet who fashioned an art in which the life and the work mirror and sustain each other (from the Introduction), Let us leave my life -- dark, oppressive/thing -- to its likeness as that blackened/ vault, under which a man sits waiting/for his day to end, and does not see/the blue sea beyond -- oh what joy to say, as you/once did, oh joy! -- or the sky above (from First Fugue (for 2 Voices)).

It recognizes that the poem is not a decorative art object but a means of organizing the world, in the words of anthropologist Clifford Geertz, ""into transient examples of shaped behavior."" Archeophonics is a series of discrete poems that are linked by repeated phrases and words, and its themes and nothing less than joy, outrage, loss, transhistorical thought, and day-to-day life. It is a private book of public and civic concerns. An online reading companion is available at petergizzi.site.wesleyan.edu.",en,3.78,Archeophonics,True,1007
History Of The Americas,"This compelling selection of recent work by internationally celebrated poet Keith Waldrop presents three related poem sequences - ""Shipwreck in Haven,"" ""Falling in Love through a Description,"" and ""The Plummet of Vitruvius"" - in a virtuosic poetic triptych. In these quasi-abstract, experimental lines, collaged words torn from their contexts take on new meanings. Waldrop, a longtime admirer of such artists as the French poet Raymond Queneau and the American painter Robert Motherwell, imposes a tonal override on purloined materials, yet the originals continue to show through. These powerful poems, at once metaphysical and personal, reconcile Waldrop's romantic tendencies with formal experimentation, uniting poetry and philosophy and revealing him as a transcendentalist for the new millennium.",en,3.91,Transcendental Studies : A Trilogy,True,801

Notwithstanding his cultural duties as a young man born into Zulu tradition, his calling as an imbongi was taken very seriously by his father and grandfather who encouraged him to write. Professor Kunene described this `calling' to write as `something [that] is not me, it is the power that rides me like a horse'. Kunene lectured widely and was Professor in African Literature at Stanford University and in African Literature and Languages at the University of California, Los Angeles. On his return to South Africa, he was Professor in African Languages at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. He went into exile in the 1960s for more than 34 years, during which time he established and managed the African National Congress office in London and later moved to Los Angeles with his family to pursue his academic career. In UNodumehlezi KaMenzi (Emperor Shaka the Great), which he wrote during this exile period, he positions Shaka as a legendary thinker, who had great skill as a strategic and military genius. This vision acknowledges and re-imagines Shaka as a unifying cultural and political force that defined the cohesive Zulu nation. Kunene projects Shaka into the mythical ancestral universe that affirms the deep cultural lineage of the African world view. This reprinted English edition is published with the isiZulu edition on the tenth anniversary of his death, embracing Kunene's original dream to have his work published as intended in the original isiZulu form.

""A Woman of Aran"", a distinguished collection of poems by Máire Áine Ní Dhireáin, niece of Máirtín Ó Direáin, has just been published by Nuascéalta. The island's landscape is evoked by the charcoal drawings of Cathal Póirtéir and the poems' original Irish is accompanied by Tomás Mac Síomóin's English translations of them. The poems of ""A Woman of Aran"" span a period stretching from the traditional Inishmore into which she was born through the years of her lengthy exile and, eventually, to her return to the island of her birth. She expresses in clear verse the emotional correlative of all these experiences, the unforgettable landscapes and seascapes of Inishmore being the constant background of her musings. Máire Áine Ní Dhireáin does not hesitate to engage with raw emotion, whether evoked by love, death or the crags of her beloved Aran, transmuting it into elegant free verse. She is always sharply conscious of the historical dimensions of her surroundings, whether in Inishmore or London. Many of her present-day fellow-Irish forget or ignore this dimension, but she has no compunction in expressing the indignation she feels at the historical wrong done to our people.

Is death ever entirely unexpected? Not, perhaps, by a collector of experience, a gourmet of language, who can refer to ""death flickering in you like a pilot light."" In AFTER ALL, Matthews seems to be looking his last on all things lovely: music, food and wine, love. In the stunning central poem, ""Dire Cure,"" which forms a kind of spine to the book, he describes the remarkable implications of the ""heroic measures"" that saved the life and restored the health of his wife from ""a children's cancer (doesn't that possessive break your heart?)."" He evokes the death of his favorite jazz musician, Charles Mingus. He speaks of cats, dogs, pigs, sheep, of the past, of history, of joys proposed, but especially, with his characteristic relaxed wit, of language and its quiddities: ""My love says I think too damn much and maybe she's right.""

In this ambitious fourth collection, Traci Brimhall corresponds with the urges of life and death within herself as she lives through a series of impossibilities: the sentencing of her friend's murderers, the birth of her child, the death of her mother, divorce, a trip sailing through the Arctic. In lullaby, lyric essay, and always with brutal sincerity, Brimhall examines how beauty and terror live right alongside each other--much like how Nod is both a fictional dreamscape and the place where Cain is exiled for murdering Abel. By plucking at the tensions between life and death, love and hate, truth and obscurity, Brimhall finds what it is that ties opposing themes together; how love and loss are married in grief. Like Eve thrust from Eden, Brimhall is tasked with finding meaning in a world defined by its cruelty. Unrelenting, incisive, and tender, these poems expose beauty in the grotesque and argue that the effort to be good always outweighs the desire to succumb to what is easy.",en,4.61,Come the Slumberless to the Land of Nod,True,1156

DeWoskin invites us into moments shaped by dualities, into spaces bordered by the language of her family (English) and that of her new country (Chinese), as well as the liminal spaces between youth and adulthood, safety and danger, humor and sorrow. This collection works by building and demolishing boundaries and binaries, sliding between their edges in movements that take us from the familiar to the strange and put us face-to-face with our assumptions and confusions. Through these complex and interwoven poems, we see how a self is never singular. Rather, it is made up of shifting--and sometimes colliding--parts. DeWoskin crosses back and forth, across languages and nations, between the divided parts in each of us, tracing overlaps and divergences.

These romances launched the plots, themes and structures of the genre, then blossoming in the hands of authors such as Chretien de Troyes. As an account of the Trojan War, Benoit's work is of necessity a poem about war and its causes, how it was fought and what its consequences were for the combatants. But the author's choice of the octosyllabic rhyming couplet, his fondness for description, his ability to recount the intensity of personal struggles, and above all his fascination with the trials and tribulations of Love, which affect some of the work's most prominent warriors (among them Paris and his love for Helen, and Troilus and his love for Briseida), all combine to fashion this romance - in which events from long ago are presented as a reflection of the poet's own feudal and courtly worlds.",en,,The Roman de Troie by Benoit de Sainte-Maure - A Translation,False,992

Investigating a culture of terrorism, paranoia, and surveillance by rendering a world divided into victims and perpetrators, UNSUB plays on the differences between catching a predator and being a catch. Through ghostly descriptions of live bodies, the book scrutinizes the vicissitudes of anonymity and subjectivity, indistinction and identity. ""By turning the forensic onto the forensic, Divya Victor splays the bodies of those wanted into bits of want: soldered-over scars and moulding desires, that glut of gut tissue and the rotting tongue's ability to speak another tongue. To UNSUB is not, as turns out, to unsubjectify, but to subjectify too highly. High as how meat goes when left too long by the side of the road.

Poetry By Individual Poets,"Every time I chance upon a fun fair and whiff of cotton candy greets my nose, I follow its enticing aroma through the whirlpool of food and game stalls, eagerly tip-toe my way up to the spinning crystals of sugar on that familiar, almost spherical machine, waiting for the cobwebby texture of the sweet treat to appear, before it is adroitly wound around long sticks, to coax it into a semblance of compact coherence. As I wait with increasing anticipation for that melt-in-the-mouth, smear-all-over-the -face sensation to end up in my hands, my mind begins to spin much like the machine itself. Caught up in its centrifugal force, an analogy draws itself around me. How life, with its myriad events, have spun around me, adding layers, weaving disparate dreams, each incident wrapping itself around another, to endow me with some sort of an identity. The spin of development, physical, emotional, cognitive, and perhaps even spiritual, weave around the corners of my mind, and in the midst of this sudden reverie, the tangible and edible cotton candy was ready for me to devour. I realised that the moisture of the air was causing the wispy delight to shrink, to diminish...how akin is our existence to a cotton candy? As we spin through it, or rather it spins around us, we keep growing, not just physically, but in all aspects of our existence and once we stop that motion, and are exposed to a lull, a stagnant pause (repesented by the water vapour in air) do we become rather flaccid, shrink, almost diminish? What does this spinning motion imply? That we have to lead excessively hectic, frenetic paced lives, in order to grow and 'prosper?' Or rather, as I would hope earnestly, does it mean that we shouldn't stop spinning our dreams, cultivating our hopes and nurturing our aspirations, making friends, entering meaningful, multi-dimensional relationships, and motivating our passions, egging on our wills, until the crystals of all such thoughts take on a tangible shape, are woven into an attainable, if fleetingly temporary reality? The sugar crystals, to me, seem to represent all the people I've known, all the incidents I've encountered, all the houses I've moved to, all the pillows I've slept on, all the books I've read, the characters I've met, the places I've loved, all the mistakes I've made, the faults I've tried and try every day to rectify, the fears I've harboured, the hopes I've treasured, the stories I've created, the truths I've taught myself to believe, the faces for which I longingly yearn, the passing emotions which I try to chronicle...and these are the ingredients of our lives, with which our identities are spun, and just as moisture almost deflates the pink mass, time will eat away at most of the superfluous layers around us, until we are left with only the sugar crystals which mean the most to us, which we value and prize the most, ranging from an unforgettable memory, the inexplicable satisfaction of a job sincerely done, a goose-bump inducing touch, a faint smell from the cupboards of the past, the sensation of a re-visited emotion, the stirring sentiment behind a forgotten tear, the beauty of vulnerability, the assurance of strength, the lessons of disillusionment, and the magnificent hope of a new, slowly unfurling dream, the varied texture of diverse bonds.

""A Spring Harvest"" is a delightful and insightful collection of poems by Geoffrey Bache Smith, a talented poet and very close high school and college friend of J.R.R. Tolkien. Smith's work shows he enjoyed writing and playing with different poetic forms and his mood varied from serious to whimsical.Smith and Tolkien, along with classmates Rob Gilson and Christopher Wiseman, formed a semi-secret society where they discussed their artistic interests and the impact each would have on the world. The society regularly met and took tea at the Tea Club and Barrovian Society, near their school. The men named their society T.C.B.S. . . . . . The personal bonds they formed through T.C.B.S. lasted their lifetimes. Unfortunately, World War I interrupted college and cut short the lives of Smith and Gilson, both killed in France at the Battle of the Somme. Gilson was shot leading a charge and Smith died of shrapnel wounds a few days later on December 3, 1916. Tolkien had contracted Trench Fever and was evacuated to England days before the battle started, escaping almost certain death.

Includes an introduction by Roberto Echavarren and an interview conducted by Silvia Guerra. This is the first English-language collection of Amanda Berenguer's poetry. A key contributor to Uruguay's famed literary Generación del 45, Berenguer (1921-2010) stands among the most important post-World War II poets of Latin America, along with her now-legendary compatriot Marosa di Giorgio. Berenguer's poetry, stylistically and conceptually varied, ranges from classic, measured lyric to Dickinson-inspired gnomic utterance; from metaphysical and erotic rhetorical effusion to condensed and radically concrete experiment; from seemingly apolitical languor to pointed ideological dissent. The poems included in this edition span a large portion of Berenguer's career and are taken from seven of her books--Materia Prima (1966), Composición de Lugar (1976), Identidad de ciertas frutas (1983), La dama de Elche (1985), La botella verde (1995), La cuidadora del fuego (2010)--and from a book of selected poems from 1968-1984, Con el tigre entre las cosas (2002).

Poetry By Individual Poets,"Ken Smith (1938-2003) was a major voice in world poetry, his work and example inspiring a whole generation of younger British poets. His politically edgy, cuttingly colloquial, muscular poetry poetry shifted territory with time, from rural Yorkshire, America and London to the war-ravaged Balkans and Eastern Europe (before and after Communism). His early books span a transition from a preoccupation with land and myth to his later engagement with urban Britain and the politics of radical disaffection. The pivotal work marking this shift was his long poem Fox Running (1980), brought to recent attention when an archive recording of him reading it was broadcast by BBC Radio 4's Poetry Please in 2016. His Collected Poems brings together poetry from four decades, including all the work from two earlier retrospectives, The Poet Reclining: Selected Poems 1962-1980 (1982) and Shed: Poems 1980-2001 (2002), together with the posthumously published You Again: last poems & other words (2004).

There he encounters the shade of the ancient Roman poet, Virgil, who offers to lead him through the nine circles of Hell. The damned of Dante's imagination, it's quite clear, have condemned themselves through their actions or inactions to become permanent prisoners of the nether regions. Down, down, down, go Dante and his guide, meeting friend and foe alike, with horror piled upon horror. Finally, they must climb Satan's body to find the only possible exit from this terrible place--where once more the poet will ""see again the stars."" A first-rate modern rendering of a literary classic!",en,4.0,"Dante's Inferno : The Divine Comedy, Book One",True,1085
Poetry By Individual Poets,"""Throughout her writing career, Tueni remained fiercely independent and unattached to fashionable schools of thought. Her fondness for her native land is intertwined with her need to reflect upon the realities and conditions that surrounded her. The operations at work in her poetry--from the varied linguistic play to the jarring juxtapositions, from the ambiguity of certain passages to the playful manipulations of syntax--are intensely original and delightfully strange. Scenes from her own childhood accompany imagery drawn from Christian mythology and rituals, while tales of lovers scorned are juxtaposed with those of gods abandoned. Revelatory descriptions of springs, mountains and street-scenes accompany metaphysical contemplations, themselves masked by layers of striking imagery. Forceful and meditative, two books that present internal and emotional landscapes as well as a sensual if fragmented portrait of her urban and natural surroundings.""",en,3.0,The Blond Texts & the Age of Embers,True,959

His work was initially published in England before it was published in America. Known for his realistic depictions of rural life and his command of American colloquial speech, [2] Frost frequently wrote about settings from rural life in New England in the early twentieth century, using them to examine complex social and philosophical themes.Frost was honored frequently during his lifetime and is the only poet to receive four Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry. He became one of America's rare ""public literary figures, almost an artistic institution.""[3] He was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 1960 for his poetic works. On July 22, 1961, Frost was named poet laureate of Vermont.Robert Frost was born in San Francisco, California, to journalist William Prescott Frost, Jr., and Isabelle Moodie.[2] His mother was a Scottish immigrant, and his father descended from Nicholas Frost of Tiverton, Devon, England, who had sailed to New Hampshire in 1634 on the Wolfrana.Frost was a descendant of Samuel Appleton, one of the early settlers of Ipswich, Massachusetts, and Rev. George Phillips, one of the early settlers of Watertown, Massachusetts.[4]Frost's father was a teacher and later an editor of the San Francisco Evening Bulletin (which later merged with The San Francisco Examiner), and an unsuccessful candidate for city tax collector. After his death on May 5, 1885, the family moved across the country to Lawrence, Massachusetts, under the patronage of (Robert's grandfather) William Frost, Sr., who was an overseer at a New England mill. Frost graduated from Lawrence High School in 1892.[5] Frost's mother joined the Swedenborgian church and had him baptized in it, but he left it as an adult.Although known for his later association with rural life, Frost grew up in the city, and he published his first poem in his high school's magazine. He attended Dartmouth College for two months, long enough to be accepted into the Theta Delta Chi fraternity. Frost returned home to teach and to work at various jobs, including helping his mother teach her class of unruly boys, delivering newspapers, and working in a factory maintaining carbon arc lamps. He did not enjoy these jobs, feeling his true calling was poetry.In 1894, he sold his first poem, ""My Butterfly. An Elegy"" (published in the November 8, 1894, edition of the New York Independent) for $15 ($434 today). Proud of his accomplishment, he proposed marriage to Elinor Miriam White, but she demurred, wanting to finish college (at St. Lawrence University) before they married. Frost then went on an excursion to the Great Dismal Swamp in Virginia and asked Elinor again upon his return. Having graduated, she agreed, and they were married at Lawrence, Massachusetts on December 19, 1895.",en,3.93,North of Boston,True,3822

She is a beautiful storyteller, eloquent and above all--best of all--she doesn't flinch from the truths of her life. Her poems are compassionate, wise and unflinching. Christie Max Williams writes,""In Lizard Season, as in all her earlier work, Norah Pollard's voice is accessible, generous, and above all, trustworthy. It's a direct, irreverent, muscular voice - a Yankee's voice. The stories contained in these new poems are so consistently and impressively compelling, and so wonderful in their narrative and emotional range, as to achieve a worldly, universal appeal and power. Many are from the poet's own life, but many others give insightful glimpses into the lives of ordinary people who have experienced extraordinary moments. These stories are often funny. And like ancient fables, they deliver epiphanies of authentic emotional wisdom. Pollard also consistently enriches her tales with gem-like turns of phrase, some of them deeply memorable and true -- 'You don't know a man until you see / the compass of his compassion.' Pollard has long been known as one of New England's best poets. With Lizard Season, it may be time to reckon her one of America's best poets.""",en,5.0,Lizard Season,True,1253

Por ello fue procesado y desterrado en 1588, año en que se casó con Isabel de Urbina (Belisa). Pasó los dos primeros años en Valencia, y luego en Alba de Tormes, al servicio del duque de Alba. En 1594, tras fallecer su esposa y su hija, fue perdonado y volvió a Madrid. Allí tuvo una relación amorosa con una actriz, Micaela Luján (Camila Lucinda) con la que tuvo mucha descendencia, hecho que no impidió su segundo matrimonio, con Juana Guardo, del que nacieron dos hijos. Entonces era uno de los autores más populares y aclamados de la Corte. En 1605 entró al servicio del duque de Sessa como secretario, aunque también actuó como intermediario amoroso de éste. La desgracia marcó sus últimos años: Marta de Nevares una de sus últimas amantes quedó ciega en 1625, perdió la razón y murió en 1632. También murió su hijo Lope Félix.

Poetry By Individual Poets,"Histories, stories, lyrics, aspirations, dreams, pressures, and images are spun into a musical tale through a site of convergence: the Black female body. Swarmed by external gazes and narratives, the inhabitant of this body uses her power to turn down this cacophony of noise and compose a symphonic space for herself. By breaching boundaries of racism, sexism, sizeism, colorism, and colonialism, these poems investigate the memories and realities of existing as Black in America. Building from poetic, journalistic, and musical histories, poet and essayist Kimberly Reyes constructs a complex and fantastic narrative in which she negotiates a path to claim her own power.  These poems teem with life, a life rich with many selves and many histories that populate in the voice of Reyes's poetic narrator. They sway between negotiations of hypervisibility and erasure, the inevitable and the chosen, and the perceived and the constructed.

History Of The Americas,"The Zhivago Affair is the dramatic, never-before-told story--drawing on newly declassified files--of how a forbidden book became a secret CIA weapon in the ideological battle between East and West. In May 1956, an Italian publishing scout went to a village outside Moscow to visit Russia's greatest living poet, Boris Pasternak. He left carrying the manuscript of Pasternak's only novel, suppressed by Soviet authorities. From there the life of this extraordinary book entered the realm of the spy novel. The CIA published a Russian-language edition of Doctor Zhivago and smuggled it into the Soviet Union. Copies were devoured in Moscow and Leningrad, sold on the black market, and passed from friend to friend. Pasternak's funeral in 1960 was attended by thousands who defied their government to bid him farewell, and his example launched the great tradition of the Soviet writer-dissident. First to obtain CIA files providing proof of the agency's involvement, Peter Finn and Petra Couvée take us back to a remarkable Cold War era when literature had the power to stir the world.

With an air of Southern Gothic mysticism, the poet reflects on a childhood spent in Houston's bayous, an adolescence rife with curiosity and shame, and a young adulthood marred by the loss of his mother. How do our bodies and minds find equilibrium as we learn to let go, yet long to remember? The title poem, ""deciduous qween, I-V,"" binds the collection in a five-part sequence, pondering those things that are lost in the seasons of our lives: teeth, antlers, body, shape, and leaf.

History Of The Americas,"Literature departments are staffed by, and tend to be focused on turning out, ""good"" readers attentive to nuance, aware of history, interested in literary texts as self-contained works. But the vast majority of readers are, to use Merve Emre's tongue-in-cheek term, ""bad"" readers. They read fiction and poetry to be moved, distracted, instructed, improved, engaged as citizens. How should we think about those readers, and what should we make of the structures, well outside the academy, that generate them? We should, Emre argues, think of such readers not as non-literary but as paraliterary thriving outside the institutions we take as central to the literary world. She traces this phenomenon to the postwar period, when literature played a key role in the rise of American power. At the same time as American universities were producing good readers by the hundreds, many more thousands of bad readers were learning elsewhere to be disciplined public communicators, whether in diplomatic and ambassadorial missions, private and public cultural exchange programs, multinational corporations, or global activist groups.",en,3.23,Paraliterary : The Making of Bad Readers in Postwar America,True,1122
Poetry By Individual Poets,"Sonnets of Love and Death introduces the difficult yet dazzling world of a neglected poet who has earned renewed recognition during the twentieth century. Jean de Sponde has finally taken his proper place in the pantheon of French poets and is now considered one of the most important short form poets who wrote between the Renaissance and Classicism. Poised between two eras, de Sponde's writing reflects all the tensions he felt at that time. In a collection of sonnets loaded with multiple metaphors, paradoxes, antitheses, and hyperbole, he carries out a restless exploration of the body and the spirit, passion and anguish, and the concrete and the abstract. David Slavitt's finely crafted translation respects the challenging nature of de Sponde's four-hundred-year-old diction and themes. While remaining faithful to the original content and sonnet form, he deftly employs contemporary English phrases and postics that appeal to the modern eye and ear.",en,3.87,Sonnets of Love and Death,True,959

"Environmental Science, Engineering & Technology","Dublin at the turn of the twentieth century was both the second city of the British Empire and the soon-to-be capital of an emerging nation, presenting a unique space in which to examine the past relationship between science and the city. Drawing on both geography and biography, Geographies of City Science underscores the crucial role urban spaces played in the production of scientific knowledge. Each chapter explores the lives of two practitioners from one of the main religious and political traditions in Dublin (either Protestant and Unionist or Catholic and Nationalist). As Tanya O'Sullivan argues, any variation in their engagement with science had far less to do with their affiliations than with their ""life spaces""-domains where human agency and social structures collide. Focusing on nineteenth-century debates on the origins of the universe as well as the origins of form, humans, and language, O'Sullivan explores the numerous ways in which scientific meaning relating to origin theories was established and mobilized in the city. By foregrounding Dublin, her book complements more recent attempts to enrich the historiography of metropolitan science by examining its provenance in less well-known urban centers.",en,,Geographies of City Science : Urban Lives and Origin Debates in Late Victorian Dublin,False,1229

But for the optimistic epithalamium moment of 'Words Need Love Too' the visionary celebration of poems like 'Agoue' again seems both possible and important to this poet whose early work had been as much about celebrating connection and the possibilities inherent in the Caribbean's rediscovery of its African heritage as it had been concerned to chronicle the barbarities and hurts of the process of cultural alienation that made such a rediscovery necessary.

"Astronomy, Space & Time","This graduate-level, course-based text is devoted to the 3+1 formalism of general relativity, which also constitutes the theoretical foundations of numerical relativity. The book starts by establishing the mathematical background (differential geometry, hypersurfaces embedded in space-time, foliation of space-time by a family of space-like hypersurfaces), and then turns to the 3+1 decomposition of the Einstein equations, giving rise to the Cauchy problem with constraints, which constitutes the core of 3+1 formalism. The ADM Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity is also introduced at this stage. Finally, the decomposition of the matter and electromagnetic field equations is presented, focusing on the astrophysically relevant cases of a perfect fluid and a perfect conductor (ideal magnetohydrodynamics). The second part of the book introduces more advanced topics: the conformal transformation of the 3-metric on each hypersurface and the corresponding rewriting of the 3+1 Einstein equations, the Isenberg-Wilson-Mathews approximation to general relativity, global quantities associated with asymptotic flatness (ADM mass, linear and angular momentum) and with symmetries (Komar mass and angular momentum). In the last part, the initial data problem is studied, the choice of spacetime coordinates within the 3+1 framework is discussed and various schemes for the time integration of the 3+1 Einstein equations are reviewed. The prerequisites are those of a basic general relativity course with calculations and derivations presented in detail, making this text complete and self-contained. Numerical techniques are not covered in this book.",en,3.0,3+1 Formalism in General Relativity : Bases of Numerical Relativity,True,1659
"Astronomy, Space & Time","Although his yeoman father is said to have burnt his books to discourage excessive studiousness, Thomas Wright (1711-86) nevertheless acquired considerable knowledge in the fields of mathematics, navigation and astronomy. Later benefitting from the patronage of wealthy families, he also surveyed estates, designed gardens, and tutored aristocrats. He is best known, however, for his contribution to astronomy: this illustrated work of 1750 was his most famous publication. Written in the form of nine letters, the book quotes both poets and scientists in the opening discussion as Wright sets out to fuse, rather than separate, science and religion. Combining his observations of the Milky Way with his theological belief in a universe of perfect order, he notes, among other things, that our galaxy appears to be disc-shaped. While largely ignored by contemporary astronomers, Wright's ideas can be seen as a forerunner to more sophisticated conceptions of our galaxy's configuration.",en,,"An Original Theory or New Hypothesis of the Universe, Founded upon the Laws of Nature : And Solving by Mathematical Principles the General Phaenomena of the Visible Creation, and Particularly the Via Lactea",False,986

"Astronomy, Space & Time","This book presents what are possibly the greatest advances in astronomy and physics for years. It quantifies the force responsible for the expansion of the universe and describes its source. It identifies the greatest destructive mechanism in the universe. The enigmas behind the Hubble constant were resolved and this led to all the discoveries. The mysteries behind dark matter and dark energy are solved. The cause of all solar energy, including gravitational and radiant energy is identified. Surprisingly hydrogen fusion is found to be responsible for the sun's remarkable prolonged stability, but it is an impossible source of surplus energy. The most unexpected finding was that time has an unusual property, one that is responsible for much of the behaviour of the universe. Also uncovered was an inverse relationship between time and mass. Another finding was the greatest catastrophe to befall the earth with after effects that we still feel today, such as shifting plate tectonics, tsunamis and earthquakes, and why the Pacific Ocean is so deep. That catastrophe led to Snowball Earth. But it also eventually caused the oxygenation of earth's atmosphere and the emergence of life. Also found were why Jupiter is so hot compared with its surroundings and what drives its equatorial storms. Another discovery was the mechanism responsible for Saturn's marvellous ring system. Also identified within that ring system was the physics behind the most spectacular sight in the solar system. But there are many other discoveries, such as that the theory of the Big Bang must be wrong, the quantification of gravitational energy and so on.

But as Charles C. Mann now makes clear, archaeologists and anthropologists have spent the last thirty years proving these and many other long-held assumptions wrong. In a book that startles and persuades, Mann reveals how a new generation of researchers equipped with novel scientific techniques came to previously unheard-of conclusions.

History Of The Americas,"With a new foreword by the author on the tenth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina--Chris Rose's New York Times bestselling collection: ""A gripping book about life's challenges in post-Katrina New Orleans...packed with heart, honesty, and wit"" (New Republic). Celebrated as a local classic and heaped with national praise, 1 Dead in Attic is a brilliant collection of columns by an award-winning Times-Picayune journalist chronicling the horrific damage and aftermath wrought by Hurricane Katrina in 2006. ""Frank and compelling...vivid and invaluable"" (Booklist), it is a roller coaster ride through a devastated American wasteland as it groans for rebirth. Full of the emotion, tragedy and even humor--which has made Chris Rose a favorite son and the voice of a lost city--these are the stories of the dead and the living, of survivors and believers, of destruction and recovery, and of hope and despair. With photographs by British photojournalist Charlie Varley, 1 Dead in Attic captures New Orleans caught between an old era and a new, New Orleans in its most desperate time, as it struggled out of floodwaters and willed itself back to life.",en,4.11,1 Dead in Attic : After Katrina,True,1143

You will see that galaxies come in many shapes and sizes, with major categories being spirals and ellipticals. There are also many irregular galaxies and galaxies undergoing mergers or being cannibalized by other galaxies. Galaxies vary tremendously in their masses, in their luminosities, in their shapes, in their star formation rates, and in the amount of gas and dust they contain. And some are near, in cosmic terms, and some are billions of light-years away, at the edge of the universe. Many are found in groups, including our own Milky Way. Others are found within very large clusters.

History Of The Americas,"Formally incorporated into the British Empire in 1908 and again in 1917, the Anterctic Peninsula and wind-blown island chains of the South Atlantic became part of a pink-tinted empire. Some in Britain hoped that the entire Antarctic continent would be annexed. Those hopes were never to be realized yet successive British governments have been determined to maintain, and even fight for Britain's territorial possessions in this faraway region of the world. ""Pink Ice"" tells the story of the political struggles over Antarctica and the South Atlantic. It shows how Great Britain and Argentina have sought to invest these thinly populated spaces, composed mostly of ice, rock and water, with cultural and national importance. This is a phenomenon by no means exclusive to the South Atlantic. Providing the wider political and historical background to the 1982 Falklands conflict, the author demonstrates how political rivalries have on different occasions been played out in other competitive arenas such as World Cup football, reactions to outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease and trade disputes wherever they have occurred.",en,3.25,Pink Ice : Britain and the South Atlantic Empire,True,1123

Two important developments, the growth of postcolonial studies and the controversy surrounding immigration from Africa to the Italian peninsula, have made it clear that the discussion of Italy's colonial past is essential to any understanding of the history and construction of the nation. This collection, the first to gather articles by the most-respected scholars in Italian colonial studies, highlights the ways in which colonial discourse has pervaded Italian culture from the post-unification period to the present. During the Risorgimento, Africa was invoked as a limb of a proudly resuscitated Imperial Rome. During the Fascist era, imperialistic politics were crucial in shaping both domestic and international perceptions of the Italian nation.

History Of The Americas,"A young college grad buys a house in Detroit for $500 and attempts to restore it--and his new neighborhood--to its original glory in this ""deeply felt, sharply observed personal quest to create meaning and community out of the fallen...A standout"" (Kirkus Reviews, starred review). Drew Philp, an idealistic college student from a working-class Michigan family, decides to live where he can make a difference. He sets his sights on Detroit, the failed metropolis of abandoned buildings, widespread poverty, and rampant crime. Arriving with no job, no friends, and no money, Philp buys a ramshackle house for five hundred dollars in the east side neighborhood known as Poletown. The roomy Queen Anne he now owns is little more than a clapboard shell on a crumbling brick foundation, missing windows, heat, water, electricity, and a functional roof. A $500 House in Detroit is Philp's raw and earnest account of rebuilding everything but the frame of his house, nail by nail and room by room. ""Philp is a great storyteller...[and his] engrossing"" (Booklist) tale is also of a young man finding his footing in the city, the country, and his own generation. We witness his concept of Detroit shift, expand, and evolve as his plan to save the city gives way to a life forged from political meaning, personal connection, and collective purpose. As he assimilates into the community of Detroiters around him, Philp guides readers through the city's vibrant history and engages in urgent conversations about gentrification, racial tensions, and class warfare.

Daniel Pauly, a well-known fisheries expert who was a co-author of all five articles, presents each original article here and surrounds it with a rich array of contemporary comments, many of which led Pauly and his colleagues to further study. In addition, Pauly documents how popular media reported on the articles and their findings.

"Astronomy, Space & Time","The International School on Physics and Astrophysics of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR2000) was held at the Observatoire de Paris-Meudon on June 26-29, 2000. This was the ?rst international school speci?cally dedicated to ultra high energy cosmic rays. Its aim was to familiarize with and attract students, physicists and astronomers into this quickly developing newresearch ?eld. The mysterious and currently unknown origin of the most energetic par- cles observed in Nature has triggered in recent years theoretical speculations ranging from electromagnetic acceleration to as yet undiscovered physics - yond the Standard Model. It has also lead to the development of several new detection concepts and experimental projects, some of which are currently - der construction. By its nature, the ?eld of ultra high energy cosmic rays is therefore highly interdisciplinary and borrows from astrophysics and cosmology, via particle physics, to experimental physics and observational astronomy. One main aspect of the school was to emphasize and take advantage of this interd- ciplinarity. The lectures were grouped into subtopics and are reproduced in this volume in the following order: After a general introductory lecture on cosmic rays follow two contributions on experimental detection techniques, followed by three lectures on acceleration in astrophysical objects. The next four contri- tions cover all major aspects of propagation and interactions of ultra high energy radiation, including speculative issues such as newinteractions.",en,,Physics and Astrophysics of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays,False,1544

"Astronomy, Space & Time","The World Machine is the second volume Piero Boitani devotes to the way in which the sciences and the arts interact when it comes to modern consideration of the stars and the cosmos (the first, also published in English by Nova Science Publishers, is entitled Looking Upwards: Stars in Ancient and Medieval Cultures). This is not a history of astronomy or astrophysics, but the story  arranged in chronological order  of how humans have reacted to fundamental changes in astronomy by means of poetry, narrative, painting, architecture, and music over the last five hundred years. This time, the story is basically European (and American), as all the relevant scientific discoveries were made in Europe, and it is the European imaginaire that dominates world culture (non-European images of the universe are dealt with in Looking Upwards). The historical development of this image and of the ideas that contribute to its formation is rather complex and diversified, but two major turning points are clearly identifiable  one lies between the sixteenth and seventeenth century, and one at the very beginning of the twentieth century. Concerning the former, the observation of the sky was revolutionized by the telescope. Galileo, Kepler and Newton could thus base their new models of the universe on much more precise experiences, and mathematics became the new language of astronomy. The cosmos increasingly tended to be viewed as a machine, a mechanism like a clock (hence the books title). Between the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century the second scientific revolution took place. The instruments became so refined that they began to detect increasingly remote objects, and the phenomena found in the sky, as well as their behavior, no longer fully responded to Newtonian laws. New theories  relativity and quantum mechanics  were elaborated, the mathematics needed for them becoming much more difficult for the layman, and the whole structure of matter, with the discovery of the atom, its constituent parts, and its particles was gradually uncovered. Things reached a critical moment with Heisenbergs and Hubbles formulation of, respectively, the uncertainty principle and of the increasing speed at which galaxies recede from us the further they are  and finally with the conflict between relativity and quantum theories. Some recent poets (notably in South America) and many painters and musicians in Europe and North America have tried to describe this new cosmos, but the same happened after the first scientific revolution. In short, The Machine of the World recounts an exciting adventure whose protagonists are the likes of Tasso and Milton, Goethe and Wallace Stevens, Canaletto and Friedrich, Verdi and Puccini, Van Gogh and Schoenberg, Joyce and Thomas Mann.",en,,The Machine of the World : The Modern Cosmos,False,2802

"Astronomy, Space & Time","This prize-winning Ph.D. thesis by Chris Harrison adopts a multi-faceted approach to address the lack of decisive observational evidence, utilising large observational data sets from several world-leading telescopes. Developing several novel observational techniques, Harrison demonstrated that energetic winds driven by Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are found in a large number of galaxies, with properties in agreement with model predictions. One of the key unsolved problems in astrophysics is understanding the influence of AGN, the sites of growing supermassive black holes, on the evolution of galaxies. Leading theoretical models predict that AGN drive energetic winds into galaxies, regulating the formation of stars. However, until now, we have lacked the decisive observational evidence to confirm or refute these key predictions. Careful selection of targets allowed Harrison, to reliably place these detailed observations into the context of the overall galaxy population. However, in disagreement with the model predictions, Harrison showed that AGN have little global effect on star formation in galaxies. Theoretical models are now left with the challenge of explaining these results.",en,,Observational Constraints on the Influence of Active Galactic Nuclei on the Evolution of Galaxies,False,1198

"Astronomy, Space & Time","Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) are well furnished laboratories in which one can investigate a number of important physical processes. These processes include: thermonuclear reactions, nebular physics, winds, mass accretion phenomena on compact objects, magnetohydrodynamics, plasmas, thermal and non thermal radiative processes, relativistic phenomena, dust forma  tion, etc . . In the recent year the most exciting development in our opinion was that the small, cold and invisible secondary components of CV s were found to be the prime motors for the evolution of close binary systems, disclosing new scenarios for research. All branches of astronomy and as  trophysics often take advantage of the new ideas brought by the study of CVs. It is for this reason, we believe, that meetings on CVs are important for most of the astronomical community. The idea of a Congress on CVs in Padova has been fluttering in the air for a few years. After all - we thought - a large part of the scientific heritage of Padova and Asiago Observatories is represented by the study of variable stars and, in particular, of CV s, as Prof. L. Rosino reminded us at the very beginning of the Congress.

"Astronomy, Space & Time","See also 'Big Bang Blasted.' Tired Light theories have been around for nearly 100 years and provide an alternative to the Big Bang and an expanding Universe. In Tired Light, redshifts are explained in terms of photons of light interacting with the electrons in the plasma of space. The photons lose energy, their frequency decreases, their wavelength increases and they have been redshifted. The energy transferred to the recoiling electron is re-radiated as a secondary photon and these form the CMBR. Tired Light theories have previously been rejected since certain tests were said to discredit it but now these objections have been overcome and Tired Light is now at the forefront of cosmological theories. Furthermore, discoveries in 2015 confirm predictions that New Tired Light made nearly 20 years ago! New Tired Light was published in a peer reviewed scientific journal in August 2016 and the book follows this development. In 2015 a fast radio burst was observed and for the first time we had the redshift of the host galaxy. This enabled the mean electron number density to be determined as 0.5 m^-3 exactly as predicted by New Tired Light nearly twenty years ago. New Tired Light provides a mechanism by which redshifts can happen and using standard Physics we can now pick any galaxy and calculate its redshift from first principles and get it right! The book chooses two galaxies used by Hubble in his earlier 1930's paper said to show the Universe is expanding and calculates the redshift in terms of a photon - electron recoil interaction. We see that there is no need for expansion as it is simple optics. The book goes on to look at the various tests such as the Tolman surface brightness test which now supports Tired Light and supernovae curve broadening which now is in doubt. It finishes with a review of Zwicky's original paper on Tired Light.",en,5.0,Tired Light : An Explanation of Redshifts in a Static Universe,True,1865
"Astronomy, Space & Time","This collection of over 1,000 pencil drawings by John Oxenham Goodman includes images of the gods and historical persons after whom the modern constellations, planets, dwarf planets, minor planets, moons and chemical elements were named. Astronomers, who have taken months or even years to decide on names for the heavenly bodies they discovered, might surely be interested in seeing these pencil drawings which number over 1000. They can now put visual images to the names they have chosen. The stars and planets are not only of interest to astronomers but to the whole of the human population of our earth. Astronomy can be popularized through art and the fascinating stories of gods, goddesses, legendary heroes and heroines. This book also contains pencil sketches of ancient Chinese heavenly bodies such as the 10 Shang Dynasty Suns, the Seven Luminaries, the 28 Lunar Mansions, the 9 Northern Dipper Stars and the 6 Southern Dipper Stars thus giving Eastern and Western perspectives of astronomy. Finally at the end of the book the Five Elements of ancient China are employed as suits in a Chinese version of Tarot using Mahjong symbols and concepts from China's 13th Century Ma Diao playing cards. I commenced these drawings in the summer of 1984/85 attempting to depict some of the Shakespearean characters after whom the moons of Uranus were named. It was in the 1980s while working in the University of Sydney Library that I had access to useful information on astronomy, Greco-Roman history and art, a prerequisite for someone wanting to depict the mythical heroes after whom the constellations, planets and their moons were mostly named. At first I wrote about each of these hundreds of mythical or historical figures and then began drawing the 88 Constellations. In 2006 I drew the remainder of the moons of Uranus which by then had grown to 27 and the moons of Neptune followed. It was only in 2010 after retiring and living in China that I completed drawings of the moons of Jupiter, Saturn and the other planets followed by the ancient Chinese planets and stars. Thus it has taken 30 years to complete this project which now incorporates a Chinese version of Tarot. This book is also a visual representation of the measurement of time using Chinese, Japanese and Western traditions. The 5 Elements of ancient China combine with the sun and moon to give us the 7 days of the week. Anglo-Saxon and Roman gods are depicted as representing the days of the week in the Western calendar. Then the animals of the 28 Chinese Lunar Mansions complete the lunar month while the 12 months of the year are represented by the monthly flowers on the Japanese Flower Cards (Hanafuda). The 12 Earthly Branches represented by 12 animals give us a 12 year period and when combined with the 10 Heavenly Stems they give us the 60 year cycle of the traditional Chinese calendar.

"Astronomy, Space & Time","Our presentation of some fundamental domains of celestial mechanics requires no special preliminary knowledge; however, the chosen mathe  matical method is new in so far as the pure two-body motion is described by linear differential equations, which even have constant coefficients. In other words an equivalence between the Keplerian motion and a harmonic oscillation is established; this approach to celestial mechanics will be referred to as the linear theory. Besides the possibility of the mutual fruitful interaction between celestial and oscillatory mechanics which is thereby created, our linear differential equations are as a result everywhere regular. The opposite is true of the classical Newtonian equations, which are singular at the collision of the two moving bodies""'Reg~larization is however not the leitmotiv of the book; the many regularization methods [1] which do not lead to linear differential equations are therefore not described. Apart from the basic idea of the use of linear differential equations and the resulting advantages, there were two further scientific goals which we had in mind. First, it should be permissible not only to transform the coordinates of the mobile but also to introduce other independent variables instead of the time. The often cumbersome solution of the Keplerian equation in theoretical studies can thereby be avoided.

He became an active amateur astronomer in the early 1930's, making extensive observations of Mars, Jupiter, and variable stars (including the bright supernova of 1937 in IC 4182). He also began life-long interests in astronomical photography and galaxy cataloguing during this period. In 1939, he met the director of the Paris transport system and an equally avid amateur astronomer, Julien Peridier. De Vaucouleurs worked at Peridier's private observatory at Le Houga in southwestern France on and off throughout the next decade. His undergraduate work was in mathematics, astronomy, and experimental physics; this, combined with his interest in observational astronomy, formed his life-long empirical approach to science.

Among the new stars there are comets, novae, and finally supernovae, the subject of this book. Superstitious mankind regarded these events as significant portents and recorded them carefully so that we have records of supernovae that may reach back as far as 1300 B. C.

Tycho's supernova of 1572, at a distance of 2500 pc, had a magnitude of -4. 0, comparable to Venus at its brightest, and Kepler's supernova of 1604 had a magnitude of - 3 or so. Thus the Cygnus Loop supernova might have had a magnitude of - 6 or so, and should have been readily visible in daytime. A supernova in Vela, about 8000 B.

"Astronomy, Space & Time","Neutron stars are gold mines for the study of nuclear systems under extreme conditions of density and isospin asymmetry. Spanning many orders of magnitude in density and pressure, neutron stars display exotic phases that cannot be realised under normal laboratory conditions. Whereas the most common perception of a neutron star is that of a uniform system of neutrons packed to densities that may exceed that of normal nuclei, the reality is far more complex and much more interesting. To illustrate this more exciting reality, the editors of this book contacted leaders in the field of neutron-star physics with expertise ranging from nuclear structure to stellar dynamics. They asked each expert to communicate the successes of the past and the challenges of the future in a way that will continue to foster dialogue and promote collaborations between the astrophysics and the nuclear physics communities.",en,,Neutron Star Crust,False,908

"Astronomy, Space & Time","Essay aus dem Jahr 2016 im Fachbereich Astronomie, Note: N/A, Sprache: Deutsch, Abstract: This paper questions the widely accepted concept of ""dark matter"", used to explain discrepancies between the current theory of gravity, as it relates to the visible mass of the universe (ie. stars, dust and gas), and the observations of the movements of stars in the spiral arms of galaxies and in clusters of galaxies. The idea of dark matter, developed in 1932 by Jan Oort and in 1933 by Fritz Zwicky, was used to explain why the observed movements of stars were are not following Kepler's third law, being the relationship between the distance of an orbiting object and it's orbital period. In this paper, I am suggesting that the gross effects of these observations are in reality the combined effects of both gravity and magnetic fields, and also the reasoning to support this hypothesis. In this paper, as well, I have tried to explain my hypothesis through language which is not overtly technical, so that an intelligent layperson would be able to understand it. It is hoped that the practical and theoretical significance of my paper will result in a re-examination of the basic, underlying foundations supporting the idea of dark matter, and that this re-examination will result in a theory which does not need to rely upon an invisible, untouchable, and all encompassing gravational source as being one of the basic planks of the theory of the universe.",de,,Another look at the Missing Mass Problem,False,1453

"Environmental Science, Engineering & Technology","Gregory F. Tague's An Ape Ethic and the Question of Personhood argues that great apes are moral individuals because they engage in a land ethic as ecosystem engineers to generate ecologically sustainable biomes for themselves and other species. Tague shows that we need to recognize apes as eco-engineers in order to save them and their habitats, and that in so doing, we will ultimately save earth's biosphere. The book draws on extensive empirical research from the ecology and behavior of great apes and synthesizes past and current understanding of the similarities in cognition, social behavior, and culture found in apes. Importantly, this book proposes that differences between humans and apes provide the foundation for the call to recognize forest personhood in the great apes. While all ape species are alike in terms of cognition, intelligence, and behaviors, there is a vital contrast: unlike humans, great apes are efficient ecological engineers. Therefore, simian forest sovereignty is critical to conservation efforts in controlling global warming, and apes should be granted dominion over their tropical forests. Weaving together philosophy, biology, socioecology, and elements from eco-psychology, this book provides a glimmer of hope for future acknowledgment of the inherent ethic that ape species embody in their eco-centered existence on this planet.",en,,An Ape Ethic and the Question of Personhood,False,1371

"Environmental Science, Engineering & Technology","When Franklin published her book on cyst nematodes in 1951, the cyst nematodes were already known as serious pests of brassicas, cereals, potatoes and sugar beets. However, at that time this group of nematode, with about 12 species, was considered tobe largely temperate in distribu  tion.

The previous impression of localization of cyst nematodes in the temperate region was seemingly an artifact due to a greater concentration of nematologists in the temperate regions. Based on my own experience of working in several Asian and African countries, I believe that many more undescribed species are present in the tropical countries of Asia and Africa, and probably in other tropical regions. Most growers, extension workers, and research managers in these regions are still not aware of the possible harm of presence of these nematodes in their agricultural soils.

"Astronomy, Space & Time","Over the last decade we have witnessed a rapid change in our understanding of the late stages of stellar evolution. A major stimulus to this has been the synthesis of observational data from different wavebands of the electromagnetic spectrum. The advent of infrared astronomy has led to the discovery of many luminous. late-type stars obscured by their circumstellar dust envelope. Sources discovered in the IRC and AFGL infrared sky surveys were followed up by radio observa  tions, leading to the widespread use of the OH and CO molecules as probes of the circumstellar envelopes. Advances in the technique of aperture synthesis have made possible observations with unprecedent resolving power, both in spectral-line and continuum. The success of the recent IRAS sky survey, with the detection of over 250,000 sources, brings the promise of even more exciting years ahead. This area of astronomical research is also blessed with the close collaboration between theorists and observers. New ideas are constantly being quantitatively tested by new data. Theoretical predictions are eagerly used as guides for further observations. This conference was initiated with the following objective: bring together workers in optical, infrared, radio and theoretical astronomy and let them confront each other. Based on the post-conference res  ponses we received, many of the participants have indeed found this Workshop a stimulating experience.

"Astronomy, Space & Time","The idea for an international symposium on the interstellar medium was first discussed at the University of Wyoming during the summer of 1984. It was obvious that the outstanding natural beauty of the Teton mountain range in northwestern Wyoming must be matched by a meeting with the broadest appeal to the astronomical community. If the meeting was to produce a book, it must likewise be an important contribution to the astronomical literature. It was for these reasons that early in the discussions, it was decided that the University should host a ""school"". with the invited speakers presenting tutorials on a broad range of topics involving the interstellar medium. The symposium proceedings would then be a compilation of the written versions of these presentations. It has been nearly a decade since Lyman Spitzer published his classic text on the interstellar medium and we felt the need for a school and book that would focus on the recent developments in our understanding of the inter  stellar medium.

In addition it was considered that Japan had been very active in the theory of star formation as well as in mm and IR observations of star forming regions. At the Patras General Assembly of the IAU the issue was brought up for discussion at meetings of Commis  sions 34 (Interstellar Matter) and 40 (Radioastronomy), the former agreed to sponsor the Symposium, while the latter agreed to co-sponsore it. The IAU Executive Committee accepted the proposal to hold the Symposium on September 1983. The Symposium was held in Tokyo on 11-15 November 1985, just before the New Delhi General Assembly.

"Astronomy, Space & Time","Space missions subject human beings or any other target of a spacecraft to a radiation environment of an intensity and composition not available on earth. Whereas for missions in low earth orbit (LEO), such as those using the Space Shuttle or Space Station scenario, radiation exposure guidelines have been developed and have been adopted by spacefaring agencies, for exploratory class missions that will take the space travellers outside the protective confines of the geomagnetic field sufficient guidelines for radiation protection are still outstanding. For a piloted Mars mission, the whole concept of radiation protection needs to be reconsidered. Since there is an increasing interest of many nations and space agencies in establishing a lunar base and lor exploring Mars by manned missions, it is both, timely and important to develop appropriate risk estimates and radiation protection guidelines which will have an influence on the design and structure of space vehicles and habitation areas of the extraterrestrial settlements.

History Of The Americas,"When we want advice, we often casually speak of reaching out to others to ""get some feedback."" But how many of us give a thought to what this phrase actually means? The idea of feedback actually dates to World War II, when the term was developed to describe the dynamics of self-regulating systems, which correct their actions by feeding their effects back into the system. For example, antiaircraft weapons systems could ""learn"" to predict how planes might try to evade them and adjust their firing patterns accordingly. By the early 1970s, feedback had evolved to become the governing trope for a counterculture that was reoriented and reinvigorated by ecological thinking. The Culture of Feedback digs deep into a dazzling variety of left-of-center experiences and attitudes from this misunderstood period, bringing us a new look at the wild side of the 1970s. Belgrad shows us how ideas from systems theory were taken up by the counterculture and the environmental movement, eventually influencing a wide range of beliefs and behaviors, particularly related to the question of what is and is not intelligence. He tells the story of a generation of Americans who were struck by a newfound interest in--and respect for--plants, animals, indigenous populations, and the very sounds around them, knitting this together with cogent insights on environmentalism, feminism, systems theory, and psychedelics. The Culture of Feedback repaints the familiar image of the '70s as a time of Me Generation malaise to reveal an era of revolutionary and hopeful social currents, driven by desires to radically improve--and feed back into--the systems that had come before.",en,,The Culture of Feedback : Ecological Thinking in Seventies America,False,1660

"Environmental Science, Engineering & Technology","This book is devoted to alkaliphiles, their microbiology, biotechnological applications and adaptive mechanisms. Alkaliphiles are extremophilic organisms that are adapted to thrive in alkaline environments. Over the years, a wide variety of alkaliphiles belonging to domain Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya have been isolated and studied. These organisms use various adaptive mechanisms to thrive in 'extreme' alkaline environments, and some of these adaptive mechanisms are of immense importance to a range of biotechnological applications. In this book, readers will learn about the adaptive strategies of alkaliphiles in colonizing alkaline habitats, with a main focus on: (1) the production of enzymes that are active and stable in the high pH environment, and (2) the production of acids that decrease the pH of their immediate surrounding environment.",en,,Alkaliphiles in Biotechnology,False,854

"Astronomy, Space & Time","In 1879, while a graduate student under Henry Rowland at the Physics Department of The Johns Hopkins University, Edwin Herbert Hall discovered what is now universally known as the Hall effect. A symposium was held at The Johns Hopkins University on November 13, 1979 to commemorate the lOOth anniversary of the discovery. Over 170 participants attended the symposium which included eleven in  vited lectures and three speeches during the luncheon. During the past one hundred years, we have witnessed ever ex  panding activities in the field of the Hall effect. The Hall effect is now an indispensable tool in the studies of many branches of condensed matter physics, especially in metals, semiconductors, and magnetic solids. Various components (over 200 million!) that utilize the Hall effect have been successfully incorporated into such devices as keyboards, automobile ignitions, gaussmeters, and satellites. This volume attempts to capture the important aspects of the Hall effect and its applications. It includes the papers presented at the symposium and eleven other invited papers. Detailed coverage of the Hall effect in amorphous and crystalline metals and alloys, in magnetic materials, in liquid metals, and in semiconductors is provided.

"Astronomy, Space & Time","This book is intended as a historical and critical study on the origin of the equations of motion as established in Newton's Principia. The central question that it aims to answer is whether it is indeed correct to ascribe to Galileo the inertia principle and the law of falling bodies. In order to accomplish this task, the study begins by considering theories on the motion of bodies from classical antiquity, and especially those of Aristotle. The theories developed during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance are then reviewed, with careful analysis of the contributions of, for example, the Merton and Parisian Schools and Galileo's immediate predecessors, Tartaglia and Benedetti. Finally, Galileo's work is examined in detail, starting from the early writings. Excerpts from individual works are presented, to allow the texts to speak for themselves, and then commented upon. The book provides historical evidence both for Galileo's dependence on his forerunners and for the major breakthroughs that he achieved. It will satisfy the curiosity of all who wish to know when and why certain laws have been credited to Galileo.",en,,Galileo and the Equations of Motion,False,1130
"Astronomy, Space & Time","Twenty-four guys went to the Moon in the late sixties/early seventies. Of them, 12 walked on its surface. Three of them made the journey twice. The author met 20 of the 24 who made the journey, and 11 of the 12 who walked on its surface, and has an archive of transcribed tapes from talks and presentations and book signings given by them. These 24 humans have been the only ones to see at first-hand what our planet looks like, slowly spinning without any visible means of suspension in the vastness of space. Who were they, and how did they describe their experience? This book provides a record of the human tales and complexity behind the technological triumph of Apollo, how going to the Moon affected them, and the lives they led on returning to Earth.

Violent death came to Chico Mendes in the Amazon rain forest on December 22, 1988. A labor and environmental activist, Mendes was targetted by powerful ranchers for organizing resistance to the wholesale burning of the forest. He was a target because he had convinced the government to take back land ranchers had stolen at gunpoint or through graft and then to transform it into ""extractive reserves,"" set aside for the sustainable production of rubber, nuts, and other goods harvested from the living forest. This was not just a local land battle on a remote frontier. Mendes had invented a kind of reverse globalization, creating alliances between his grassroots campaign and the global environmental movement.

"Astronomy, Space & Time","First observed by Galileo, Saturn lies in the distant reaches of the solar system; it is the sixth planet, a gaseous giant between Jupiter and Uranus. It takes its name from the mythological father of Jupiter and Roman god of agriculture. Because of the famous circle of rings Saturn is one of the most well-regarded occupants of the galaxy. Despite their continuous appearance from Earth, the rings are actually space dust and debris trapped by Saturn's gravitational pull, a fact garnered from several satellite passes and telescope observations. The origin of Saturn's rings, however, remains a mystery. Apart from the rings, we also are aware of its moon system, with the most intriguing planetoid called Titan, itself having been the subject of science fiction speculation as a home to life. Saturn has been visited by Pioneer 11 and the two Voyager probes, with Cassini slated to arrive in 2004. Our study of this most intriguing planet will continue into the foreseeable future, with the hopes of resolving the mysteries it hides.

"Astronomy, Space & Time","Dust is ubiquitous in the universe and responsible for stellar and planetary formation. Virtually all previous studies have considered the dust particulates to be a charge neutral component. Satellite missions such as Voyager revealed the extent to which charged dust plays a role in astrophysics. In most areas dust exists in the presence of a dilute plasma. In such a plasma environment the dust becomes charged to a variety of processes (eg photo-ionisation, collisions with electrons and ions, thermionic emission etc). Closer to home in the Earth's mesosphere, rocket measurements and radar observations conclusively demonstrate the importance of charged dust in forming complex structures responsible for Polar Mesospheric Summer Echoes. This book is the outcome of a periodic collaboration between a small group of scientists meeting twice a year at the International Space Science Institute (ISSI) in Bern, Switzerland over a period of three years. The book begins with a description of the fundamental physical processes which characterise dusty plasmas. environment, the review progresses to non-linear dust dynamics of spherical and irregular dust. In an ensemble of a dust plasma system collective processes begin to manifest themselves in the form of new wave modes and instabilities which play an important role in the collective behaviour displayed in space and astrophysical environment.

European History,"In Architecture in Translation, Esra Akcan offers a way to understand the global circulation of culture that extends the notion of translation beyond language to visual fields. She shows how members of the ruling Kemalist elite in Turkey further aligned themselves with Europe by choosing German-speaking architects to oversee much of the design of modern cities. Focusing on the period from the 1920s through the 1950s, Akcan traces the geographical circulation of modern residential models, including the garden city-which emphasized green spaces separating low-density neighborhoods of houses surrounded by gardens-and mass housing built first for the working-class residents in industrial cities and, later, more broadly for mixed-income residents. She shows how the concept of translation-the process of change that occurs with transportation of people, ideas, technology, information, and images from one or more countries to another-allows for consideration of the sociopolitical context and agency of all parties in cultural exchanges. Moving beyond the indistinct concepts of hybrid and transculturation and avoiding passive metaphors such as import, influence, or transfer, translation offers a new approach relevant to many disciplines. Akcan advocates a commitment to a new culture of translatability from below for a truly cosmopolitan ethics in a globalizing world.",en,4.1,"Architecture in Translation : Germany, Turkey, and the Modern House",True,1379

It is notable for being ""a rare, nearby example of a young planetary system just entering the last phase of planet formation."" 51 Ophiuchi has a disk of dust and gas that appears to be a young debris disk and is probably a planetary system in the late stages of formation. This system resembles Beta Pictoris, a well known star with a large debris disk, in several ways: spectral type, the presence of an edge-on disk with both gas and dust, and the presence of variable blue-shifted absorption lines suggesting in-falling comets.",en,,51 Ophiuchi,False,809
"Astronomy, Space & Time","This book is a Ph.D thesis. The elaborated study was carried out in Moroccan city (Meknes City) and more particularly along the Oued Boufekrane River that passes inside this city. Many samples (soil, sediment and water) were collected along the study area and during two campaigns of sampling. The collected samples were analyzed using different analytical techniques mainly WD-XRF and ICP-AES. The treatment and the interpretation of the obtained results were carrying out exploiting many statistical tools. So, statistical tests were used to compare the results obtained by WD-XRF and ICP-AES; and the multivariate statistics was applied to define the emission sources in the studied area. The analyses of metal contents in soil samples showed that the distribution of these elements, along the studied sites, is homogeneous; with the exception of Pb that showed high contents at the vicinity of the road axes. In sediments, two groups have been distinguished; the first group showed enrichment downstream the city and the second group indicated enrichment inside the city. These results have been corroborated by the calculation of the correlation matrixes and a Principal Components Analysis.",en,,Application of Multielement Techniques to Evaluate the Metal Contents,False,1196

"Astronomy, Space & Time","Space travel revolves around the answers to three major questions that have confronted explorers for thousands of years: 1) Where will we go? 2) What will we do when we get there? 3) How will it benefit folks back home? Far beyond the technological issue of how to actually travel in space is the very practical issue of answering these questions long before we turn the first screw in the hardware, or the first plank in a ship's hull is layed. This book is a condensed version of the companion books: Interstellar Travel: An Astronomer's Guide, and Interplanetary Travel: An Astronomer's guide, which covered these issues in more technical detail. Answers are provided using the best, current, astronomical knowledge of our solar system and the thousands of exoplanets that have been discovered in recent years, including Proxima Centauri b and the exciting, new TRAPPIST-1 planetary system.

The astonishing Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had running water and immaculately clean streets, and was larger than any contemporary European city. Mexican cultures created corn in a specialized breeding process that it has been called man's first feat of genetic engineering.

European History,"Histories of Technology, the Environment, and Modern Britain brings together historians with a wide range of interests to take a broad, multifaceted look at how technology and the environment have become intimately and irreversibly entangled in Britain over the last three hundred years. For the first time, the book brings together two perspectives with ample insights into the history of Britain since the Industrial Revolution: the history of technology and environmental history. Both technologies and our living and nonliving environment comprise material forms of organization--or self-organization--and both have changed over time, sometimes in intersecting ways. Among the technologies discussed in the collection are bulldozers, submarine cables, automobiles, flood barriers, medical devices, museum displays, and biotechnologies. Environments discussed include both places of natural beauty and pollution, bogs, cities, farms, land, and sea. The book explores this diversity and offers an integrated framework for understanding these intersections.",en,,"Histories of Technology, the Environment and Modern Britain",False,1058

"Environmental Science, Engineering & Technology","In recent decades, new scientific information has transformed our understanding of forest ecosystems, driving forest policy changes in both Canada and the United States. The extraction-oriented policies that dominated forest management for more than a century have given way to new approaches, leading often to acrimonious public debate, controversy over the interpretation of science, and frequent litigation by groups who support conflicting points of view. Today, the U.S. and Canada face a common challenge: to achieve a sustainable form of forest management that has wide public support. Many books discuss the scientific changes underlying forest policy, but this is the first to examine the social and economic aspects of sustainable forestry and the resulting impacts on resource policy in the two countries. The authors attempt to make sense of citizens' expectations for forests, and the responses by public-land managers and policymakers. Contributors include sociologists, research foresters, economists, political scientists, and geographers, as well as scholars in recreation and tourism. Together, their writings provide an in-depth interdisciplinary perspective on Canadian and U.S. efforts to manage public forests on a sustainable basis. The premise of ""Two Paths toward Sustainable Forests is that academics and students, resource professionals, policymakers, and members of industry, environmental, and forest community groups can benefit from a comparison of the situations on either side of the border.

"Environmental Science, Engineering & Technology","In the marine environment, single-celled, microscopic, plant-like organisms naturally occur in the well-lit surface layer of any body of water. These organisms, referred to as phytoplankton or microalgae, form the base of the food web upon which nearly all other marine organisms depend. Algal bloom is a rapid increase in or accumulation of the population of about 300 species of algae due to excess nutrients (eutrophication), and is of major global interest as it causes reduction in species diversity, abrupt changes in water quality, and discoloration of the water (green, yellow, brown or red) depending on the species of algae and the type of pigments they contain. Dying blooms can also be an environmental concern as when the cells sink and decay, bacteria break down the organic material, which in turn strips oxygen from the water. This microbial oxygen demand at times leads to very low oxygen levels in the bottom waters, harming aquatic life. Documentation of this sporadic high abundance of algae, together with the significant species richness of the diatoms, requires comprehensive studies in the Sundarban coastal environment, which is facing severe degradation due to natural & anthropogenic stressors. In addition, a better understanding of the effects of algal blooms on seafood quality, the complex biological, chemical and physical interactions and subsequent effects on trophodynamics is needed to develop strategies for effective coastal zone management.",en,,"Marine Algal Bloom: Characteristics, Causes and Climate Change Impacts",False,1479

"Environmental Science, Engineering & Technology","As environmental challenges grow larger in scale and implications, it is increasingly important to apply the best scientific knowledge in the decisionmaking process. Editors Farrell and Jager present environmental assessments as the bridge between the expert knowledge of scientists and engineers on the one hand and decisionmakers on the other. When done well, assessments have a positive impact on public policy, the strategic decisions of private firms, and, ultimately, the quality of life for many people. This book is the result of an international, interdisciplinary research project to analyze past environmental assessments and understand how their design influenced their effectiveness in bringing scientific evidence and insight into the decisionmaking process. The case studies in the book feature a wide range of regional and global risks, including ozone depletion, transboundary air pollution, and climate change. Assessments of Regional and Global Environmental Risks offers several important contributions. It provides a clear account of the choices faced in the design of environmental assessments and a clear description of the lessons learned from past assessments. It illustrates why assessments are social processes, not simply reports. And, while they identify no universal, one-size-fits-all design, the authors find that, to be effective, environmental assessments must be viewed by those who produce and use them as being salient; credible in their scientific support; and legitimate, or fair in design and execution.",en,,Assessments of Regional and Global Environmental Risks : Designing Processes for the Effective Use of Science in Decisionmaking,False,1543

In lakes and rivers, the management of water supply and quality has largely proceeded on the basis of local considerations rather than at the global scale that has been more typical of environmental management of the atmosphere and ocean. It is increasingly apparent, however, that high-quality water resources are now in critically short supply not only because of local problems such as over-irrigation and eutrophication, but also as a result of larger-scale climate effects on the hydrosphere.

"Environmental Science, Engineering & Technology","The discipline encompassing the use of high-resolution geophysics for obtaining geoengineering survey data has evolved rapidly over the past decades to become an interdisciplinary subject encompassing the fields of Geophysics, engineering, geology, marine geology, oceanography, and civil engineering. While high-resolution geophysical surveys are routinely performed offshore today, this has been so only since the late 1960s. High-resolution geophysical methods are employed in the offshore environment to obtain a comprehensive picture of the sea-floor mor  phology and underlying shallow stratigraphy. The purpose of the survey methods is to assist in the design and installation of bottom-supported structures such as drilling and production platforms and pipelines. Drilling structures and pipelines of steel and/or concrete have become behemoths with respect to their size and the complexity of their design in order to withstand, for periods of up to twenty-five years, an extremely harsh environment, including storm waves, strong currents, unstable sea  floor conditions, and great water depths. It is therefore of paramount importance that the geometry and physical properties of the sea floor be well understood in order to provide an adequate foundation for the design lives of such structures. On land, engineering foundation data usually may be obtained by visual field inspection and shallow borehole information, but offshore the presence of the water column places certain constraints on geoengineering investigations. High-resolution geophysical methods employed in the acquisition of geoengineering data offshore are defined as the use of seismic sources and receivers that operate at acoustic frequencies greater than 100 Hz.",en,,Applied High-Resolution Geophysical Methods : Offshore Geoengineering Hazards,False,1746

"Environmental Science, Engineering & Technology","For much of our history, legal scholars focused predominantly on the law's implications for human beings, while ignoring how the law influences animal welfare. Since the 1970s, however, there has been a steep increase in animal advocates' use of the courts. Animal law has blossomed into a vibrant academic discipline, with a rich literature that examines how the law affects animal welfare and the ability of humans to advocate on behalf of nonhuman animals. But most animal law literature tends to be doctrinally-based or normative.

History Of The Americas,"Through a minute-by-minute analysis of the phone calls, official reports, responses, and reported actions of passengers on two hijacked flights, United Airlines 93 (which crashed in Pennsylvania) and American Airlines 77 (which crashed into the Pentagon), Elaine Scarry offers a dramatic retelling of their fate and some startling conclusions. Leading off a provocative debate, she asks if the difficulty we had as a country in defending ourselves on September 11 suggests serious flaws in our national security. The need to act in'a matter of minutes' has been invoked to justify military arrangements increasingly outside the citizenry's control, yet the only successful defense on September 11 was carried out, after a vote, by the passengers themselves on hijacked Flight 93. Arguments made at the time of the writing of the Constitution judged that the only plausible way to defend the home ground was to have actions measured against the norms of civilian life: the military had to be'held within a civil frame.' Scarry asks, have we strayed too far from this model? Does our authoritarian conception of national defense diminish our capacity to protect ourselves? Is it legal? Is it moral?

History Of The Americas,"This is the field manual for Civil War soldiers. When the Civil War began in 1861, thousands of volunteers rallied to the colors to defend their families, their homes, and the Union or the Confederacy, as they chose. Comparatively few of these patriotic young men were trained veterans of military campaigns or graduates of a military academy. Before hundreds of regiments marched off to war, John Penn Curry, a veteran of Indian campaigns in the West and a former US Navy officer, wrote a practical handbook for soldiers to help them survive the hardships of life in the field. Curry's handbook was published twice, once in New York in 1861 and again in Richmond in 1862 and was used by both Union and Confederate soldiers lucky enough to find a copy. After the war, Curry's handbook passed into obscurity. In 2006 a rare, original copy of the 1862 edition surfaced in Florida. After 144 years, Curry's """"Volunteers' Camp and Field Book"""" can provide a glimpse into basic training before the bloodiest conflict in American history. Curry's handbook is fascinating for its practical approach to problems. Snakebite, for example, should be treated by drinking whiskey to excess since there was sure to be whiskey in camp. Even with ill-fitting shoes, soap rubbed on wool socks can prevent blisters on the march.

History Of The Americas,"Throughout history, battlefields have placed a soldier's instinct for self-preservation in direct opposition to the army's insistence that he do his duty and put himself in harm's way. Enduring Battle looks beyond advances in weaponry to examine changes in warfare at the very personal level. Drawing on the combat experiences of American soldiers in three widely separated wars-the Revolution, the Civil War, and World War II-Christopher Hamner explores why soldiers fight in the face of terrifying lethal threats and how they manage to suppress their fears, stifle their instincts, and marshal the will to kill other humans. Hamner contrasts the experience of infantry combat on the ground in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when soldiers marched shoulder-to-shoulder in linear formations, with the experiences of dispersed infantrymen of the mid-twentieth century. Earlier battlefields prized soldiers who could behave as stoic automatons; the modern dispersed battlefield required soldiers who could act autonomously. As the range and power of weapons removed enemies from view, combat became increasingly depersonalized, and soldiers became more isolated from their comrades and even imagined that the enemy was targeting them personally. What's more, battles lengthened so that exchanges of fire that lasted an hour during the Revolutionary War became round-the-clock by World War II. The book's coverage of training and leadership explores the ways in which military systems have attempted to deal with the problem of soldiers' fear in battle and contrasts leadership in the linear and dispersed tactical systems. Chapters on weapons and comradeship then discuss soldiers' experiences in battle and the relationships that informed and shaped those experiences. Hamner highlights the ways in which the ""band of brothers"" phenomenon functioned differently in the three wars and shows that training, conditioning, leadership, and other factors affect behavior much more than political ideology. He also shows how techniques to motivate soldiers evolved, from the linear system's penalties for not fighting to modern efforts to convince soldiers that participation in combat would actually maximize their own chances for survival. Examining why soldiers continue to fight when their strong instinct is to flee, Enduring Battle challenges long-standing notions that high ideals and small unit bonds provide sufficient explanation for their behavior. Offering an innovative way to analyze the factors that enable soldiers to face the prospect of death or debilitating wounds, it expands our understanding of the evolving nature of warfare and its warriors.",en,3.88,"Enduring Battle : American Soldiers in Three Wars, 1776-1945",True,2666

"Environmental Science, Engineering & Technology","The rather excessive public preoccupation of the immediate past with what has been labeled the 'environmental crisis' is now fortunately being replaced by a more sus  tained and rational concern with pollution problems by public administrators, engineers, and scientists. It is to be expected that members of the engineering profes  sion will in the future widely be called upon to design disposal systems for gaseous and liquid wastes which meet strict pollution control regulations and to advise on possible improvements to existing systems of this kind. The engineering decisions involved will have to be based on reasonably accurate quantitative predictions of the effects of pollutants introduced into the atmosphere, ocean, lakes and rivers. A key input for such calculations comes from the theory of turbulent diffusion, which enables the prediction of the concentrations in which pollutants may be found in the neighborhood of a release duct, such as a chimney or a sewage outfall. Indeed the role of diffusion theory in pollution prediction may be likened to the role of applied mechanics (,strength of materials') in the design of structures for adequate strength. At least a certain group of engineers will have to be proficient in applying this particular branch of science to practical problems. At present, training in the theory of turbulent diffusion is available only at the gra  duate level and then only in a very few places.",en,3.0,Turbulent Diffusion in the Environment,True,1444

The first was to fulfill the need for an introductory level book combining the multidisciplinary aspects of atmospheric pollution. This book does cover most of the key facets: sources and sinks of atmospheric pollutants, atmospheric chemistry, transport and meteorology, effects on human beings and vegetation, and surveillance of air quality. The length of the book was purposely limited so that the cost would be within the means of most interested users. The second reason for preparing this book was stimulated by my mother-in-law, Mrs Clayton D. Root, Councilwoman and member of the Planning Commission of Crown Point, Indiana, who pointed out that all governmental levels must make decisions affecting the atmospheric quality of their regions of responsibility and yet have little information on atmospheric pollution for their assistance. For the most part the achievement of air quality standards is a local problem and every locality is unique.",en,,Introduction to the Scientific Study of Atmospheric Pollution,False,1652

U.S.A. (Received November I, 1984; revised May 14, 1985) Abstract. An integrated, interdisciplinary, intensive study of three forested watersheds in the Adirondack Park region of New York State was started in 1977 to quantify the relationship between the deposition of atmospheric acids and surface water acidity. A general mechanistic theory of lake-watershed acidification that takes into account the production and consumption of acidity by watershed processes, as well as atmospheric inputs of acidity, was developed. This theory is formulated as a mathematical simulation model. Model and data analyses establish the importance of using an integrated ecosystem perspective to assess the vulnerability of surface waters to acidification by acidic deposition. The acid-base status of surface waters is determined by the interaction of many factors: soil, hydrologic, vegetation, geologic, climatic, atmospheric. The absolute and relative contribution of any given factor can be highly variable, both geographically and temporally; hence, lake sensitivity to changes in the quality and quantity of atmospheric deposition is also highly variable.",en,,Integrated Lake-Watershed Acidification : Ilwas Project,False,1490

Soil contamination and remediation feature as important topics in TNO's environmental research programme. In view of the international scope of the problem, TNO organized an international conference on this subject in Utrecht, the Netherlands, in November 1985, which met with a worldwide response from the scientific community as well as from governments and industry. The international interest taken in soil contamination is underlined by the fact that the Second International Conference on Contaminated Soil takes place in a country where remedial action is being given high political priority.",en,,"Contaminated Soil '88 : Second International TNO/BMFT Conference on Contaminated Soil, 11-15 April 1988, Hamburg, Federal Republic of Germany",False,1217

"Environmental Science, Engineering & Technology","Humans and animals are not the only creatures that migrate. Plants also do. This book is  a comprehensive and analytical account of the migration of an Old World plant, water hyacinth (also known to botanists as Eichhornia Crassipes) from the Amazon Basin and surrounding areas to Africa through human agency from about 1800 to the present. As an integrative work, which benefits from methodologies and conceptual approaches drawn from limnology, botany, biology, geography, history, ecology and other social sciences and humanities, the book further explores the political, economic, and ecological consequences of the spread of water hyacinth from its native habitat through European botanical gardens to Africa rivers, lakes, dams, and wetlands. In part, as a narrative of Western tinkering with African ecologies gone awry, the study has strong lessons for environmental historians, and social scientists as well as contemporary foundations, aid workers, development experts and African governments. Although it may appear to be a micro-history of a single plant, water hyacinth, it illuminates broader issues in the history of the modern environment in Africa and similar studies worldwide. This study is primarily rooted on the histories of colonialism, bioinvasion, environmental realities and experiences in Africa. The highly visible pathways of hyacinth's spread across international frontiers along watercourses and communication networks means that not only is this a trans-boundary environmental affair, but one which directly involves bilateral relations between African states.",en,,A History of the Water Hyacinth in Africa : The Flower of Life and Death from 1800 to the Present,False,1592

It is argued that due to physiological constraints, metatherian evolution closely followed the conditions imposed by global temperatures. In general terms, during the Paleocene and the early Eocene multiple radiations of metatherian lineages occurred, with many adaptive types exploiting insectivorous, frugivorous, and omnivorous adaptive zones. In turn, a mixture of generalized and specialized types, the latter mainly exploiting carnivorous and granivorous-folivorous adaptive zones, characterized the second half of the Cenozoic.

History Of The Americas,"Houston's meteoric rise from a bayou trading post to the world's leading oil supplier owes much to its geography, geology, and climate: the large natural port of Galveston Bay, the lush subtropical vegetation, the abundance of natural resources. But the attributes that have made it attractive for industry, energy, and urban development have also made it particularly susceptible to a variety of environmental problems. """"Energy Metropolis"""" presents a comprehensive history of the development of Houston, examining the factors that have facilitated unprecedented growth - and the environmental cost of that development. The landmark Spindletop strike of 1901 made inexpensive high-grade Texas oil the fuel of choice for ships, industry, and the infant automobile industry. Literally overnight, oil wells sprang up around Houston. In 1914, the opening of the Houston Ship Channel connected the city to the Gulf of Mexico and international trade markets. Oil refineries sprouted up and down the channel, and the petroleum products industry exploded. By the 1920s, Houston also became a leading producer of natural gas, and the economic opportunities and ancillary industries created by the new energy trade led to a population boom. By the end of the twentieth century, Houston had become the fourth largest city in America. Houston's expansion came at a price, however. Air, water, and land pollution reached hazardous levels as legislators turned a blind eye. Frequent flooding of altered waterways, deforestation, hurricanes, the energy demands of an air-conditioned lifestyle, increased automobile traffic, exponential population growth, and an ever-expanding metropolitan area all escalated the need for massive infrastructure improvements. The experts in """"Energy Metropolis"""" examine the steps Houston has taken to overcome laissez-faire politics, indiscriminate expansion, and infrastructural overload. What emerges is a profound analysis of the environmental consequences of large-scale energy production and unchecked growth.",en,3.83,Energy Metropolis : An Environmental History of Houston and the Gulf Coast,True,2035

"Environmental Science, Engineering & Technology","For More Than A Century, The World has recognized the extraordinary biological diversity of the forests of Tanzania's Usambara Mountains. As international attention has focused on forest conservation, farmers, foresters, biologists, and the Tanzanian state have realized that only complex negotiations will save these treasured, but rapidly disappearing, landscapes. Highland Sanctuary unravels the complex interactions among agriculture, herding, forestry, the colonial state, and the landscape itself. In his examination of the region's history of ecological transformation, Christopher Conte demonstrates how these forces have combined to create an ever-changing mosaic of forest and field. His study illuminates the debate over conservation, arguing that contingency and chance, the stuff of human history, have shaped forests in ways that rival the power of nature. In Highland Sanctuary, the forest becomes part of human history, rather than something outside of it. Highland Sanctuary cuts through a legacy of contention and ill will to inform contemporary conservation initiatives. Professor Conte explains how ecological changes take divergent paths in similar environments, in this case on mountains that harbor unique flora and fauna, and how these mountain environments achieve international importance as centers of biodiversity.",en,4.0,Highland Sanctuary : Environmental History In Tanzanias Usambara Mountains,True,1342
"Environmental Science, Engineering & Technology","How Nature Speaks illustrates the convergence of complexity theory in the biophysical and social sciences and the implications of the science of complexity for environmental politics and practice. This collection of essays focuses on uncertainty, surprise, and positionality-situated rather than absolute knowledge-in studies of nature by people embedded within the very thing they purport to study from the outside. The contributors address the complicated relationship between scientists and nature as part of a broader reassessment of how we conceive of ourselves, knowledge, and the world that we both inhabit and shape.Exploring ways of conceiving the complexity and multiplicity of humans' many interactive relationships with the environment, the contributors provide in-depth case studies of the interweaving of culture and nature in socio-historical processes. The case studies focus on the origin of environmental movements, the politicization of environmental issues in city politics, the development of a local energy production system, and the convergence of forest management practices toward a dominant scheme. They are supported by explorations of big-picture issues: recurring themes in studies of social and environmental dynamics, the difficulties of deliberative democracy, and the potential gains for socio-ecological research offered by developmental systems theory and Pierre Bourdieu's theory of intentionality.",en,4.0,How Nature Speaks : The Dynamics of the Human Ecological Condition,True,1434
History Of The Americas,"Landscapes of Power and Identity is a groundbreaking comparative history of two colonies on the frontiers of the Spanish empire-the Sonora region of northwestern Mexico and the Chiquitos region of eastern Bolivia's lowlands-from the late colonial period through the middle of the nineteenth century. An innovative combination of environmental and cultural history, this book reflects Cynthia Radding's more than two decades of research on Mexico and Bolivia and her consideration of the relationships between human societies and the geographic landscapes they inhabit and create. At first glance, Sonora and Chiquitos are quite different: one a scrub-covered desert, the other a tropical rainforest of the greater Amazonian and Paraguayan river basins. Yet the regions are similar in many ways. Both were located far from the centers of colonial authority, organized into Jesuit missions and linked to the principal mining centers of New Spain and the Andes, and then absorbed into nation-states in the nineteenth century. In each area, the indigenous communities encountered European governors, missionaries, slave hunters, merchants, miners, and ranchers.Radding's comparative approach illuminates what happened when similar institutions of imperial governance, commerce, and religion were planted in different physical and cultural environments. She draws on archival documents, published reports by missionaries and travelers, and previous histories as well as ecological studies and ethnographies. She also considers cultural artifacts, including archaeological remains, architecture, liturgical music, and religious dances. Radding demonstrates how colonial encounters were conditioned by both the local landscape and cultural expectations; how the colonizers and colonized understood notions of territory and property; how religion formed the cultural practices and historical memories of the Sonoran and Chiquitano peoples; and how the conflict between the indigenous communities and the surrounding creole societies developed in new directions well into the nineteenth century.",en,3.2,Landscapes of Power and Identity : Comparative Histories in the Sonoran Desert and the Forests of Amazonia from Colony to Republic,True,2086
"Environmental Science, Engineering & Technology","In Kumaon in northern India, villagers set hundreds of forest fires in the early 1920s, protesting the colonial British state's regulations to protect the environment. Yet by the 1990s, they had begun to conserve their forests carefully. In his innovative historical and political study, Arun Agrawal analyzes this striking transformation. He describes and explains the emergence of environmental identities and changes in state-locality relations and shows how the two are related. In so doing, he demonstrates that scholarship on common property, political ecology, and feminist environmentalism can be combined-in an approach he calls environmentality-to better understand changes in conservation efforts. Such an understanding is relevant far beyond Kumaon: local populations in more than fifty countries are engaged in similar efforts to protect their environmental resources.Agrawal brings environment and development studies, new institutional economics, and Foucauldian theories of power and subjectivity to bear on his ethnographical and historical research. He visited nearly forty villages in Kumaon, where he assessed the state of village forests, interviewed hundreds of Kumaonis, and examined local records. Drawing on his extensive fieldwork and archival research, he shows how decentralization strategies change relations between states and localities, community decision makers and common residents, and individuals and the environment. In exploring these changes and their significance, Agrawal establishes that theories of environmental politics are enriched by attention to the interconnections between power, knowledge, institutions, and subjectivities.",en,3.65,Environmentality : Technologies of Government and the Making of Subjects,True,1674

Thompson examines the history of the land drainage movement and the inevitable environmental changes caused by the intensification of urban and rural land use in the Midwest between sixty and one hundred years ago. He shows how institutions of land drainage were organized and operated and how the nascent drainage engineering and contracting sectors functioned. Focusing on the lower valley, Thompson also deals with drainage as it affects the nation, the Midwest, Chicago, and downstate Illinois. Thompson is the first to address the array of interrelated physical, economic, and political circumstances caused by the development of competing and incompatible uses for the waters and the floodplain of the Illinois River when large-scale land reclamation and great volumes of water from Lake Michigan and Chicago changed land and water relationships, destroyed a major riverine fishing industry, and severely damaged renowned waterfowl hunting grounds.",en,4.0,"Wetlands Drainage, River Modification and Sectoral Conflict in the Lower Illinois Valley, 1890-1930",True,1344

"Environmental Science, Engineering & Technology","After a decades-long economic slump, the city of Flint, Michigan, struggled to address chronic issues of toxic water supply, malnutrition, and food security gaps among its residents. A community-engaged research project proposed a resilience assessment that would use panarchy theory to move the city toward a more sustainable food system. Flint is one of many examples that demonstrate how panarchy theory is being applied to understand and influence change in complex human-natural systems. Applied Panarchy, the much-anticipated successor to Lance Gunderson and C.S. Holling's seminal 2002 volume Panarchy, documents the extraordinary advances in interdisciplinary panarchy scholarship and applications over the past two decades. Panarchy theory has been applied to a broad range of fields from economics to law to urban planning, changing the practice of environmental stewardship for the better in measurable, tangible ways.  Panarchy describes the way systems--whether forests, electrical grids, agriculture, coastal surges, public health, or human economies and governance--are part of even larger systems that interact in unpredictable ways. Although humans desire resiliency and stability in our lives to help us understand the world and survive, nothing in nature is permanently stable. How can society anticipate and adjust to the changes we see around us? Where Panarchy proposed a framework to understand how these transformational cycles work and how we might influence them, Applied Panarchy takes the scholarship to the next level, demonstrating how these concepts have been modified and refined. The book shows how panarchy theory intersects with other disciplines, and how it directly influences natural resources management and environmental stewardship.

These issues include: Managing water resources in an era of climate change. Acidification of soils and lakes in Europe. Long-term forestry management and the possibility of a future shortfall in wood supply. Areas of Europe marginalized by mainstream economic and agricultural development. Sea level rise. Chemical pollution of coastal waters. Toxic materials buildup and the potential for chemical time bombs. Non-point-source emissions of potentially toxic substances.

It further shows the impact of bilateral relations on the resolution of transboundary river water disputes, even as good political relationships do not always guarantee the absence of river water disputes between riparian states. The book looks at some key questions: How political are India's transboundary river water disputes in South Asia? Why do the roots of India's river water disputes with Bangladesh and Pakistan lie in the partition of the British India in 1947? Why are there reservations against India's hydroelectricity projects or allegations of water theft?

This is in no way an attempt to deny that CO2 is a green house gas and warms up when exposed to infrared radiation at the temperature the earth is now at. Neither is it an attempt to deny that increasing CO2 in the atmosphere changes the climate, or to argue that our climate is not changing. Denying know facts backed by experimental results is not only a waste of time, but counterproductive. But questioning how and what known laws and facts are applied is the foundation of all sciences and has not been adequately addressed in this debate. As we are all aware there has been a bit of paranoia going around the entire planet for the last 40 years stoked by people who have not taken all the data into consideration. This irrational fear was labeled Global Warming, and like all fear campaigns it has some basis in truth but mostly a psychological war to encourage people to do something. And this something was to get people to use fewer fossil fuels and instead use ""renewable"" power sources. There is not a single factor which drove this irrational fear, but all the factors did wind up being associated with money and ego. Whether it was a desire to extend political power and influence, gain funding for research, ego massaging, gain more manufacturing diversity, grow the economy, or whatever, there were many people who saw it as an opportunity and jumped on the band wagon. So let's just realize there are a lot of people with either a monetary or ego stake in what the movement is doing, and right or wrong neither of those is going away. Unfortunately the Politicians and others wound up choosing the most dangerous path possible because: 1 Cold kills, warmth gives life. 2 CO2 enhances plant and animal life on earth. 3 The earth is headed into uncharted astronomical waters and they chose possibly the worst future for life in general. 4 We may not be able to stop the warming because the primary driver may not be CO2 .

"Environmental Science, Engineering & Technology","As we enter the twenty-first century the ultimate objective of environmental management programs should be to manipulate ecosystems so that they fulfill the needs of humans and at the same time maintain their integrity. In this new ground-breaking work, Scott Isard and Stuart Gage look at the importance of anticipating consequences of the aerial flow of biota as new strategies to understand and manage our environment. A sound understanding of the biological and meteorological interactions that govern the movement of organisms in the atmosphere is a prerequisite to the development of successful management strategies for terrestrial ecosystems. Inflows and outflows of organisms to and from habitats can be as important as birth and death rates in regulating the dynamics of populations. Isard and Gage focus on predicting events that destabilize relationships among organisms and between populations and their environment. This preventive management strategy is based on the premise that the ability to understand and predict dynamics of populations in an ecosystem allows for optimal and integrative use of a wide variety of methods to enhance human resource production and to reduce harmful impacts of diseases and organisms on humans. It is a paradigm that focuses on manipulating ecosystems to maintain the long-term stability of their diverse populations and the interactions among organisms and their environment. In many ecological systems, sudden and dramatic population fluctuations often result from movement of biota from one habitat to another. The design of grand plans to manage ecosystems without concern for the inflow and outflow of organisms associated with those ecosystems could be tragic.""",en,,Flow of Life in the Atmosphere : A Perspective on Managing Pests and Diseases at Large Spatial and Temporal Scales,False,1717

What difference does race make in the fields where food is grown, the places it is sold and the manner in which it is eaten? How do we understand farming and provisioning, tasting and picking, eating and being eaten, hunger and gardening better by paying attention to race? This collection argues there is an unacknowledged racial dimension to the production and consumption of food under globalization. Building on case studies from across the world, it advances the conceptualization of race by emphasizing embodiment, circulation and materiality, while adding to food advocacy an antiracist perspective it often lacks. Within the three socio-physical spatialities of food - fields, bodies and markets - the collection reveals how race and food are intricately linked. An international and multidisciplinary team of scholars complements each other to shed light on how human groups become entrenched in myriad hierarchies through food, at scales from the dining room and market stall to the slave trade and empire.

The telegraph debate reveals that what we understand as the normative relationship between private capital and public interest is the product of a historical process that was neither inevitable nor uncontested. Western Union's monopoly was not the result of market logic or a managerial revolution, but the conscious creation of entrepreneurs protecting their investments.

"Environmental Science, Engineering & Technology","Over the past 40 years, countries throughout the world have similarly adopted human rights related to environmental governance and protection in national constitutions. Interestingly, these countries vary widely in terms of geography, politics, history, resources, and wealth. This raises the question: why do some countries have constitutional environmental rights while others do not? Bringing together theory from law, political science, and sociology, a global statistical analysis, and a comparative study of constitutional design in South Asia, Gellers presents a comprehensive response to this important question. Moving beyond normative debates and anecdotal developments in case law, as well as efforts to describe and categorize such rights around the world, this book provides a systematic analysis of the expansion of environmental rights using social science methods and theory. The resulting theoretical framework and empirical evidence offer new insights into how domestic and international factors interact during the constitution drafting process to produce new law that is both locally relevant and globally resonant.

"Environmental Science, Engineering & Technology","Current trends in population growth hint that global food production is unlikely to gratify future demands under predicted climate change scenarios unless the rates of crop improvement are accelerated. Crop production faces numerous challenges, due to changing environmental conditions and evolving needs for new plant-derived materials. These challenges come at a time when the plant sciences are witnessing remarkable progress in understanding fundamental processes of plant growth and development. Drought, heat, cold and salinity are among the major abiotic stresses that often cause a series of morphological, physiological, biochemical and molecular alterations which adversely affect plant growth, development and productivity, consequently posing a serious challenge for sustainable food production in large parts of the world, particularly in emerging countries. This emphasizes the urgency of finding better ways to translate new advances in plant science into concrete successes in agricultural production. To overcome the pessimistic influence of abiotic stresses and to maintain the food security in the face of these challenges, new, improved and tolerant crop varieties, contemporary breeding techniques, and cavernous understanding of the mechanisms that counteract detrimental climate changes are indubitably needed to sustain the requisite food supply. In this context, Improvement of Crops in the Era of Climatic Changes, Volume 1 provides a state-of-the-art guide to recent developments that aid in the understanding of plant responses to abiotic stresses and lead to new horizons vis-a-vis prime strategies for translating current research into applied solutions to create strong yields and overall crop improvement under such unfavourable environments.",en,,Improvement of Crops in the Era of Climatic Changes : Volume 1,False,1774

History Of The Americas,"An esteemed journalist delivers a compelling on-the-ground account of the construction of President Trump's border wall in San Diego--and the impact on the lives of local residents. In August of 2019, Donald Trump finished building his border wall--at least a portion of it. In San Diego, the Army Corps of engineers completed two years of construction on a 14-mile steel beamed barrier that extends eighteen-feet high and cost a staggering $147 million. As one border patrol agent told reporters visiting the site, ""It was funded and approved and it was built under his administration. It is Trump's wall."" 14 Miles is a definitive account of all the dramatic construction, showing readers what it feels like to stand on both sides of the border looking up at the imposing and controversial barrier. After the Department of Homeland Security announced an open call for wall prototypes in 2017, DW Gibson, an award-winning journalist and Southern California native, began visiting the construction site and watching as the prototype samples were erected.

"Environmental Science, Engineering & Technology","The environment is prone to suffer pollution and toxic insult from generations of nanomaterials as well from accidental releases during production, transportation, and disposal operations. The NMs could interact with and cause adverse biological effects at cellular, subcellular, and molecular levels. Assessing potential environmental/ecological risks requires quality information on transport and fate of nanoparticles in the environment, exposures and vulnerabilities of organisms to the nanomaterials and standard methods for assessing toxicity for aquatic or terrestrial organisms and human health. The systematic risk characterization and evaluation of the safety of nanomaterials require a multidisciplinary approach and convergence of knowledge and efforts from researchers and experts from toxicology, biotechnology, materials science, chemistry, physics, engineering, and other branches of life sciences. Although studies are beginning to appear in the literature addressing the toxicity of various nanomaterials and their potential for exposure, at this stage definitive statements regarding the impacts of nanomaterials on human health and the environment remain sketchy requiring an increased level of precautions with regard to nanomaterials, as has happened with other emerging contaminants and technologies (e.g., biotechnology). The need for an increased level of understanding the perception of risk and of benefits will vary and is likely to influence public, regulatory, and non-governmental activities regarding risk and benefit evaluations. Systematic identification and assessment of the risks posed by any new technology are essential. A prudent, integrated, and holistic approach is required to develop best practices based on the scientific understanding about what we know and what we don't know but need to know.  Nanomaterials addresses key issues of ecotoxicological actions and effects of nanomaterials on life and environment, their threats, vulnerability, risks, and public perception. The readers learn to read bad news objectively and think about and search for ecological 'green' solutions to current environmental and ecological problems with blue, grey, brown, and red shades for building a sustainable ecosystem. It shows how this molecular terrain is a common ground for interdisciplinary research and education that will be an essential component of science, engineering and technology in the future.

GC-MS was mandated for the analysis of 114 compounds, yet the spectra of many of them, if they had been recorded at all, were scattered throughout the literature. Moreover, it soon became apparent that, even if a sufficient number of instruments could be made available to undertake the task of monitoring 114 substances in the effluents of 21 categories of industry, the personnel could not be trained to perform the analyses and interpret the results.

Earth observation from satellites is critical to provide information required for informed and timely decision making in this regard. Satellite-based earth observation has advanced rapidly over the last 50 years, and there is a plethora of satellite sensors imaging the Earth at finer spatial and spectral resolutions as well as high temporal resolutions. The amount of data available for any single location on the Earth is now at the petabyte-scale. An ever-increasing capacity and computing power is needed to handle such large datasets. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud-based computing platform that was established by Google to support such data processing. This facility allows for the storage, processing and analysis of spatial data using centralized high-power computing resources, allowing scientists, researchers, hobbyists and anyone else interested in such fields to mine this data and understand the changes occurring on the Earth's surface. This book presents research that applies the Google Earth Engine in mining, storing, retrieving and processing spatial data for a variety of applications that include vegetation monitoring, cropland mapping, ecosystem assessment, and gross primary productivity, among others.

To be sure, environmental factors such as topography and weather powerfully shaped the outcomes of battles and campaigns, and the war could not have been fought without the horses, cattle, and other animals that were essential to both armies. But here Judkin Browning and Timothy Silver weave a far richer story, combining military and environmental history to forge a comprehensive new narrative of the war's significance and impact. As they reveal, the conflict created a new disease environment by fostering the spread of microbes among vulnerable soldiers, civilians, and animals; led to large-scale modifications of the landscape across several states; sparked new thinking about the human relationship to the natural world; and demanded a reckoning with disability and death on an ecological scale.

It's a picturesque way of talking that includes expressions like go the whole hog, and the wild boasts of frontiersman Davy Crockett, who claimed to be ""half horse, half alligator, and a touch of the airthquake."" Splendiferous Speech explores the main sources of the American vernacular--the expanding western frontier, the bumptious world of politics, and the sensation-filled pages of popular nineteenth-century newspapers. It's a process that started with the earliest English colonists (first word adoption--the Algonquian raccoon) and is still going strong today.

"Environmental Science, Engineering & Technology","This book deals with quantifying and analyzing the risks associated with sustainable energy technology growth in electric power systems, and developing appropriate models and methodologies to mitigate the risks and improve the overall system performance. The rapid increase in the installation of renewable energy sources in electric power systems has given rise to a wide range of problems related to planning and operation of power systems to maintain quality, stability, reliability and efficiency. Additionally, there is a growing global environmental concern regarding increasing emissions from the electric power generation required to meet rising energy needs and support sustainable and inclusive development.  The phenomenon of low voltage ride through (LVRT), common to wind energy systems, is discussed, and ways to tackle the same are proposed in the first chapter. Subsequent chapters propose methods of optimizing a sustainable and smart microgrid,  and supplying electricity to remote areas of a developing country with no immediate possibility of national grid extension. The economic benefit and technical challenges of forming localized minigrid are also discussed. The book proposes a method for reliability assessment of a power grid with sustainable power transportation system. The issue of weak link in power system is very important as it will provide the system operators and planners to take necessary measures to strengthen the system. An approach to determine the weak parts of the system and its unreliability is proposed. With increasing installation of HVDC power transmission and development of efficient and low cost power electronic devices, the DC microgrids are becoming a common phenomenon. Their existence together with AC Grids result in Hybrid AC/DC Microgrids, which are discussed in this book. It further presents a method for reliability evaluation of a distribution system with network reconfiguration in the presence of distributed generation. The important problems in sustainable energy growth, and their potential solutions discussed and presented in the book should be of great interest to engineers, policy makers, researchers and academics in the area of electric power engineering.",en,,"Sustainable Power Systems : Modelling, Simulation and Analysis",False,2233

Well find another book, because this one's about gambling, pimps, prostitutes, crooked officials, hard drinking, liquor fueled brawling and the roughnecks at the center of it all...real life in Texas oil boomtowns. In 1901, George Parker Stoker was twenty-three and a newly hatched MD seeking his fortune. He stepped off the train at Beaumont into a world of mud and mayhem. Within a day he was at the Spindletop field and had inherited the only medical practice in town from an old doc who wanted to ""go on a drunk"" for a few months. Stoker spent the next few years patching up the inmates of this oil patch asylum. He worked at Spindletop, Batson Prairie and Saratoga. This was no tea-sipping engagement. The work was as hard as the men, who risked death in ways that Edgar Allen Poe couldn't have dreamed up. But boy were they paid! All that idle cash made saloons pop up like toadstools, tacked together from pine planks. Roofs leaked and there were no doors...because they never closed.

"Environmental Science, Engineering & Technology","Traditionally protected as monopolies, electric utilities are now being caught in the fervor for deregulation that is sweeping the country. Nearly forty states have enacted or are considering laws and regulations that will profoundly alter the way the electric utility industry is governed. Concerned citizens are beginning to ponder the environmental implications of such a change, and while many fear that the pressure of competition will exacerbate environmental problems, others argue that deregulation provides a tremendous opportunity for citizens to work toward promoting cleaner energy and a more sustainable way of life.In Reinventing Electric Utilities, Ed Smeloff and Peter Asmus consider the challenges for citizens and the utility industry in this new era of competition. Through an in-depth case study of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD), a once-troubled utility that is now widely regarded as a model for energy efficiency and renewable energy development, they explore the changes that have occurred in the utility industry, and the implications of those changes for the future. The SMUD portrait is complemented by regional case studies of Portland General Electric and the Washington Public Power Supply System, the New England Electric Service, Northern States Power, the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas, and others that highlight the efforts of citizen groups and utilities to eliminate unproductive and environmentally damaging sources of power and to promote the use of new, cleaner energy technologies.The authors present and explain some of the fundamental principles that govern restructuring, while acknowledging that solutions will depend upon the uniqueresource needs, culture, and utility structure of each particular region. Smeloff and Asmus argue that any politically sustainable restructuring of the electric services industry must address the industry's high capital cost commitments and environmental burdens.Throughout, they make the case that with creative leadership, open and competitive markets, and the active participation of citizens, this upheaval offers a unique opportunity for electric utilities to lessen the burden of electricity production on the environment and reduce the cost of electric services through the use of more competitive, cleaner power sources.While neither technological innovation nor the magic of the market will in and of itself reinvent the electric utility industry, the influence of those dynamic forces must be understood.

"Environmental Science, Engineering & Technology","The subject of rainfall-runoff modeling involves a wide spectrum of topics. Fundamental to each topic is the problem of accurately computing runoff at a point given rainfall data at another point. The fact that there is currently no one universally accepted approach to computing runoff, given rainfall data, indicates that a purely deter  ministic solution to the problem has not yet been found. The technology employed in the modern rainfall-runoff models has evolved substantially over the last two decades, with computer models becoming increasingly more complex in their detail of describing the hydrologic and hydraulic processes which occur in the catchment. But despite the advances in including this additional detail, the level of error in runoff estimates (given rainfall) does not seem to be significantly changed with increasing model complexity; in fact it is not uncommon for the model's level of accuracy to deteriorate with increasing complexity. In a latter section of this chapter, a literature review of the state-of-the-art in rainfall-runoff modeling is compiled which includes many of the concerns noted by rainfall-runoff modelers. The review indicates that there is still no deterministic solution to the rainfall-runoff modeling problem, and that the error in runoff estimates produced from rainfall-runoff models is of such magnitude that they should not be simply ignored.",en,,Stochastic Integral Equations and Rainfall-Runoff Models,False,1400

Volunteer fire companies protected highly flammable cities from fire and provided many men with friendship, brotherhood, and a way to prove their civic virtue. While other scholars have claimed that fire companies were primarily working class, Greenberg shows that they were actually mixed social groups: merchants and working men, immigrants and native-born--all found a common identity as firemen.

History Of The Americas,"A riveting, real-life thriller about 1983--the year tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union nearly brought the world to the point of nuclear Armageddon The year 1983 was an extremely dangerous one--more dangerous than 1962, the year of the Cuban Missile Crisis. In the United States, President Reagan vastly increased defense spending, described the Soviet Union as an ""evil empire,"" and launched the ""Star Wars"" Strategic Defense Initiative to shield the country from incoming missiles. Seeing all this, Yuri Andropov, the paranoid Soviet leader, became convinced that the US really meant to attack the Soviet Union and he put the KGB on high alert, looking for signs of an imminent nuclear attack. When a Soviet plane shot down a Korean civilian jet, Reagan described it as ""a crime against humanity."" And Moscow grew increasingly concerned about America's language and behavior. Would they attack? The temperature rose fast. In November the West launched a wargame exercise, codenamed ""Abel Archer,"" that looked to the Soviets like the real thing. With Andropov's finger inching ever closer to the nuclear button, the world was truly on the brink. This is an extraordinary and largely unknown Cold War story of spies and double agents, of missiles being readied, intelligence failures, misunderstandings, and the panic of world leaders. With access to hundreds of astonishing new documents, Taylor Downing tells for the first time the gripping but true story of how near the world came to nuclear war in 1983.",en,4.26,"1983 : Reagan, Andropov, and a World on the Brink",True,1528

As a member of the duke's inner circle, Decembrio was in a privileged position to write what historians agree is a unique masterpiece of Renaissance biography, based on his decades of direct experience. Also included in this volume is a work of homage to Visconti's successor, Decembrio's flattering account of the deeds of the most successful mercenary captain of the Renaissance, Francesco Sforza, who secured for himself and his heirs the disputed position of Duke of Milan through guile, force, and willpower.

While feminism is a major intellectual and political tradition in Ireland, it has been misrepresented and misunderstood in mainstream Irish studies.

History Of The Americas,"In July 1969, while the world was expectant about the upcoming first manned landing on the moon, two little-known Central American States crossed sabers in what was derogatorily coined by the media as 'The Soccer War'. Far from a simple out-of-hand sports passion, this conflict had its complicated origins back in the early 20th century when the North American companies United Fruit and its rival, Standard Fruit, operated in Honduras - and both deemed it necessary to import workers from El Salvador, since the locals were insufficient in numbers. What followed was an exodus of more than 300,000 Salvadorans who settled in Honduras - and for a while, the latter country's government saw this with good eyes. That is until the early 1960s, when political changes and the liberalization of the region's commerce through the Common Market Treaty made it painfully evident that the country that benefited the most from it was El Salvador, while Honduras would be destined to carry a heavy economic burden. Inevitably, it chilled the relations between the two countries and had a direct bearing in the treatment from the Hondurans towards the Salvadoran peasants.",en,,The 100 Hour War : The Conflict Between Honduras and El Salvador in July 1969,False,1162

History Of The Americas,"Writing has long been linked to power. For early modern people on both sides of the Atlantic, writing was also the province of notaries, men trained to cast other people's words in official forms and make them legally true. Thus the first thing Columbus did on American shores in October 1492 was have a notary record his claim of territorial possession. It was the written, notarial word-backed by all the power of Castilian enforcement-that first constituted Spanish American empire. Even so, the Spaniards who invaded America in 1492 were not fond of their notaries, who had a dismal reputation for falsehood and greed. Yet Spaniards could not do without these men. Contemporary scholars also rely on the vast paper trail left by notaries to make sense of the Latin American past. How then to approach the question of notarial truth? Kathryn Burns argues that the archive itself must be historicized. Using the case of colonial Cuzco, she examines the practices that shaped document-making. Notaries were businessmen, selling clients a product that conformed to local ""custom"" as well as Spanish templates. Clients, for their part, were knowledgeable consumers, with strategies of their own for getting what they wanted. In this inside story of the early modern archive, Burns offers a wealth of possibilities for seeing sources in fresh perspective.",en,3.93,Into the Archive : Writing and Power in Colonial Peru,True,1353

Drawing on Machiavelli's entire body of writings, and including little-known quotations as well as famous passages, the book shows the full scope of his thought and belies the cliche that he was a ""Machiavellian"" cynic.

They are the product of the diversity of regions and cultures that makes up the country. In Endless Periphery, Stephen J. Campbell examines a range of iconic works in order to unlock a rich series of local references in Renaissance art that include regional rulers, patron saints, and miracles, demonstrating, for example, that the works of Titian spoke to beholders differently in Naples, Brescia, or Milan than in his native Venice. More than a series of regional microhistories, Endless Periphery tracks the geographic mobility of Italian Renaissance art and artists, revealing a series of exchanges between artists and their patrons, as well as the power dynamics that fueled these exchanges. A counter history of one of the greatest epochs of art production, this richly illustrated book will bring new insight to our understanding of classic works of Italian art.",en,,The Endless Periphery : Toward a Geopolitics of Art in Lorenzo Lotto's Italy,False,1091
European History,"Genealogies of Citizenship is a remarkable rethinking of human rights and social justice. As global governance is increasingly driven by market fundamentalism, growing numbers of citizens have become socially excluded and internally stateless. Against this movement to organize society exclusively by market principles, Margaret Somers argues that socially inclusive democratic rights must be counter-balanced by the powers of a social state, a robust public sphere and a relationally-sturdy civil society. Through epistemologies of history and naturalism, contested narratives of social capital, and Hurricane Katrina's racial apartheid, she warns that the growing authority of the market is distorting the non-contractualism of citizenship; rights, inclusion and moral worth are increasingly dependent on contractual market value. In this pathbreaking work, Somers advances an innovative view of rights as public goods rooted in an alliance of public power, political membership, and social practices of equal moral recognition - the right to have rights.",en,4.08,"Genealogies of Citizenship : Markets, Statelessness, and the Right to Have Rights",True,1057

How did we get here? In this first-rate intellectual history, Leah N. Gordon jumps into this and other big questions about race, power, and social justice. To answer these questions, From Power to Prejudice examines American academia both black and white in the 1940s and '50s. Gordon presents four competing visions of the race problem and documents how an individualistic paradigm, which presented white attitudes as the source of racial injustice, gained traction. A number of factors, Gordon shows, explain racial individualism's postwar influence: individuals were easier to measure than social forces; psychology was well funded; studying political economy was difficult amid McCarthyism; and individualism was useful in legal attacks on segregation. Highlighting vigorous midcentury debate over the meanings of racial justice and equality, From Power to Prejudice reveals how one particular vision of social justice won out among many contenders.",en,3.66,From Power to Prejudice : The Rise of Racial Individualism in Midcentury America,True,1157

History Of The Americas,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER - Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jon Meacham helps us understand the present moment in American politics and life by looking back at critical times in our history when hope overcame division and fear. NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR - The Christian Science Monitor - Southern Living  Our current climate of partisan fury is not new, and in The Soul of America Meacham shows us how what Abraham Lincoln called the ""better angels of our nature"" have repeatedly won the day. Painting surprising portraits of Lincoln and other presidents, including Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, and Lyndon B. Johnson, and illuminating the courage of such influential citizen activists as Martin Luther King, Jr., early suffragettes Alice Paul and Carrie Chapman Catt, civil rights pioneers Rosa Parks and John Lewis, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and Army-McCarthy hearings lawyer Joseph N. Welch, Meacham brings vividly to life turning points in American history. He writes about the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the birth of the Lost Cause; the backlash against immigrants in the First World War and the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s; the fight for women's rights; the demagoguery of Huey Long and Father Coughlin and the isolationist work of America First in the years before World War II; the anti-Communist witch-hunts led by Senator Joseph McCarthy; and Lyndon Johnson's crusade against Jim Crow. Each of these dramatic hours in our national life have been shaped by the contest to lead the country to look forward rather than back, to assert hope over fear--a struggle that continues even now. While the American story has not always--or even often--been heroic, we have been sustained by a belief in progress even in the gloomiest of times. In this inspiring book, Meacham reassures us, ""The good news is that we have come through such darkness before""--as, time and again, Lincoln's better angels have found a way to prevail.",en,4.24,The Soul of America : The Battle for Our Better Angels,True,2056

Three hundred years ago the Parliament of Scotland, in one of its last acts before the nation lost its political identity, defied the King and the persistent hostility of the English to establish a noble trading company, to settle a colony, and to recover its people from a century of despair, privation, famine and decay.",en,3.8,Darien Disaster,True,459
History Of The Americas,"The Great Recession, institutional dysfunction, a growing divide between urban and rural prospects, and failed efforts to effectively address immigration have paved the way for a populist backlash that disrupts the postwar bargain between political elites and citizens. Whether today's populism represents a corrective to unfair and obsolete policies or a threat to liberal democracy itself remains up for debate. Yet this much is clear: these challenges indict the triumphalism that accompanied liberal democratic consolidation after the collapse of the Soviet Union. To respond to today's crisis, good leaders must strive for inclusive economic growth while addressing fraught social and cultural issues, including demographic anxiety, with frank attention. Although reforms may stem the populist tide, liberal democratic life will always leave some citizens unsatisfied. This is a permanent source of vulnerability, but liberal democracy will endure so long as citizens believe it is worth fighting for.",en,3.85,Anti-Pluralism : The Populist Threat to Liberal Democracy,True,1006
History Of The Americas,"""A must-read for fans of presidential history."" --USA TODAY ""Splendid...a gripping, authoritative campaign history."" --The Boston Globe ""Terrific...a tougher and more balanced account of the long campaign than anybody's written yet."" --The Christian Science Monitor A behind-the-scenes, revelatory account of John F. Kennedy's wily campaign to the White House, beginning with his bold, failed attempt to win the vice presidential nomination in 1956. A young and undistinguished junior plots his way to the presidency and changes the way we nominate and elect presidents. John F. Kennedy and his young warriors invented modern presidential politics. They turned over accepted wisdom that his Catholicism was a barrier to winning an election and plotted a successful course to that constituency. They hired Louis Harris--a polling entrepreneur--to become the first presidential pollster. They twisted arms and they charmed. They lined up party bosses, young enthusiasts, and fellow Catholics and turned the traditional party inside out. The last-minute invitation to Lyndon B. Johnson for vice president in 1956 surprised them only because they had failed to notice that he wanted it. They invented The Missile Gap in the Cold War and out-glamoured Richard Nixon in the TV debates. Now acclaimed, award-winning journalists Tom Oliphant and Curtis Wilkie provide the most comprehensive account, based on a depth of personal reporting, interviews, and archives. The authors have examined more than 1,600 oral histories at the John F. Kennedy library; they've interviewed surviving sources, including JFK's sister Jean Smith, and they draw on their own interviews with insiders including Ted Sorensen and Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. From the start of the campaign in 1955 when his father tried to persuade President Johnson to run with JFK as his running mate, The Road to Camelot reveals him as a tough, shrewd political strategist who kept his eye on the prize.

European History,"Beloved as the city of light, Paris in the nineteenth century sparked the acclaim of poets and the odium of the bourgeois with its distinctive sounds. Street vendors bellowed songs known as the Cris de Paris that had been associated with their trades since the Middle Ages; musicians itinerant and otherwise played for change; and flaneurs-writers, fascinated with the city's underside, listened and recorded much about what they heard. Aimee Boutin tours the sonic space that orchestrated the different, often conflicting sound cultures that defined the street ambience of Paris. Mining accounts that range from guidebooks to verse, Boutin braids literary, cultural, and social history to reconstruct a lost auditory environment. Throughout, impressions of street noise shape writers' sense of place and perception of modern social relations. As Boutin shows, the din of the Cris contrasted economic abundance with the disparities of the capital, old and new traditions, and the vibrancy of street commerce with an increasing bourgeois demand for quiet. In time, peddlers who provided the soundtrack for Paris's narrow streets yielded to modernity, with its taciturn shopkeepers and wide-open boulevards, and the fading songs of the Cris became a dirge for the passing of old ways.",en,2.66,City of Noise : Sound and Nineteenth-Century Paris,True,1282

History Of The Americas,"From Tim Weiner, winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, an urgent and gripping account of the 75-year battle between the US and Russia that led to the election and impeachment of an American president. With vivid storytelling and riveting insider accounts, Weiner traces the roots of political warfare - the conflict America and Russia have waged with espionage, sabotage, diplomacy and disformation - from 1945 until 2020. America won the cold war, but Russia is winning today. Vladimir Putin helped to put his chosen candidate in the White House with a covert campaign that continues to this moment. Putin's Russia has revived Soviet-era intelligence operations gaining ever more potent information from--and influence over--the American people and government. Yet the US has put little power into its defense. This has put American democracy in peril. Weiner takes us behind closed doors, illuminating Russian and American intelligence operations and their consequences. To get to the heart of what is at stake and find potential solutions, he examines long-running 20th century CIA operations, the global political machinations of the Soviet KGB around the world, the erosion of American political warfare after the Cold War, and how 21st century Russia has kept the cold war alive.

European History,"Pulitzer Prize-finalist Stephen Kotkin has written the definitive biography of Joseph Stalin, from collectivization and the Great Terror to the conflict with Hitler's Germany that is the signal event of modern world history  In 1929, Joseph Stalin, having already achieved dictatorial power over the vast Soviet Empire, formally ordered the systematic conversion of the world's largest peasant economy into ""socialist modernity,"" otherwise known as collectivization, regardless of the cost.  What it cost, and what Stalin ruthlessly enacted, transformed the country and its ruler in profound and enduring ways. Building and running a dictatorship, with life and death power over hundreds of millions, made Stalin into the uncanny figure he became. Stephen Kotkin's Stalin: Waiting for Hitler, 1929-1941 is the story of how a political system forged an unparalleled personality and vice versa.  The wholesale collectivization of some 120 million peasants necessitated levels of coercion that were extreme even for Russia, and the resulting mass starvation elicited criticism inside the party even from those Communists committed to the eradication of capitalism. But Stalin did not flinch. By 1934, when the Soviet Union had stabilized and socialism had been implanted in the countryside, praise for his stunning anti-capitalist success came from all quarters. Stalin, however, never forgave and never forgot, with shocking consequences as he strove to consolidate the state with a brand new elite of young strivers like himself. Stalin's obsessions drove him to execute nearly a million people, including the military leadership, diplomatic and intelligence officials, and innumerable leading lights in culture.  While Stalin revived a great power, building a formidable industrialized military, the Soviet Union was effectively alone and surrounded by perceived enemies. The quest for security would bring Soviet Communism to a shocking and improbable pact with Nazi Germany. But that bargain would not unfold as envisioned. The lives of Stalin and Hitler, and the fates of their respective dictatorships, drew ever closer to collision, as the world hung in the balance.  Stalin: Waiting for Hitler, 1929-1941 is a history of the world during the build-up to its most fateful hour, from the vantage point of Stalin's seat of power. It is a landmark achievement in the annals of historical scholarship, and in the art of biography.",en,4.47,"Stalin : Waiting for Hitler, 1929-1941",True,2431
History Of The Americas,"Books on 9/11 tend to get dismissed as ""conspiracy theories"" but that won't work with this one, because it contains no theories at all about who did what. It simply focuses on flaws in the official story that have led more than 1500 architects and engineers, with 25,000 years of professional experience (and tens of thousands of others) to demand a new, independent investigation. The book lists fourteen clearly observable facts about 9/11 that the official story can't explain, then provides a simple explanation that accounts for all of them. It raises hundreds of questions like: Why has no other skyscraper ever been destroyed by fire, even ones that raged for seventeen or eighteen hours? How could the Twin Towers fall so evenly and so fast, straight down through 160,000 tons of structural steel? How could the smaller, lighter floors above where the planes hit completely destroy the much heavier, stronger and completely undamaged floors below? For that matter, how could the top of the South Tower crush the floors below it if it began its fall toppling off them? (See the cover above.)

European History,"In this important and original study, the myth of the Noble Savage is an altogether different myth from the one defended or debunked by others over the years. That the concept of the Noble Savage was first invented by Rousseau in the mid-eighteenth century in order to glorify the 'natural' life is easily refuted. The myth that persists is that there was ever, at any time, widespread belief in the nobility of savages. The fact is, as Ter Ellingson shows, the humanist eighteenth century actually avoided the term because of its association with the feudalist-colonialist mentality that had spawned it 150 years earlier. The Noble Savage reappeared in the mid-nineteenth century, however, when the 'myth' was deliberately used to fuel anthropology's oldest and most successful hoax. Ellingson's narrative follows the career of anthropologist John Crawfurd, whose political ambition and racist agenda were well served by his construction of what was manifestly a myth of savage nobility.",en,3.38,The Myth of the Noble Savage,True,988
European History,"In October 2017 Stephen Kotkin, professor of history at Princeton University, published ""Stalin. Waiting for Hitler, 1929 - 1941."" In it, Kotkin accuses Soviet leader Joseph Stalin of dozens of terrible crimes and atrocities.The appearance of Kotkin's scholarship is daunting: 909 pages of text, more than 5200 footnotes, and 47 pages of bibliography in tiny, triple-column type. But Grover Furr has carefully and methodically studied every one of the hundreds of allegations of atrocity, crime, and misdeeds of any kind that Kotkin attributes to Stalin and his closest advisers. Furr has checked every reference, every article and book, that Kotkin cites as evidence. The result: Furr has found that every single ""crime"" Kotkin alleges is false - a fabrication. Not a single accusation holds up. On the evidence, Stalin committed NO crime, no atrocities - for if he had, Kotkin would surely have uncovered at least one. Furr's exhaustive research shows that Soviet history of the 1930s, has been falsified. Furr's book is a model of meticulous examination of evidence and careful, objective analysis and deduction.""Stalin. Waiting For ... The Truth"" exposes the lies and falsehoods behind Soviet history of the 1930s with the same meticulous attention to detail as his previous works: ""Khrushchev Lied"" (2011), ""The Murder of Sergei Kirov"" (2013), ""Blood Lies"" (2014), ""Trotsky's 'Amalgams'"" (2015), ""Yezhov vs. Stalin"" (2016), ""Leon Trotsky's Collaboration with Germany and Japan"" (2017), and ""The Mystery of the Katyn Massacre; The Evidence, The Solution"" (2018).",en,4.66,Stalin Waiting For ...

Miroslav Hroch develops and demonstrates empirically the concept of a three-stage process of nationalist mobilization: heightened cultural awareness of national distinctiveness among intellectuals and literati, a concept of nationalism as a political program, and mass mobilization on behalf of this doctrine. Hroch shows how the character of a state's nationalism is shaped by the timing of each of these phases in relation to other social transformations, especially economic changes. Amid all the speculation and theorizing about the nationalist currents in contemporary Eastern Europe (as well as in other regions), Hroch's empirically based study helps counter the impulse toward easy and spectacular generalizations and provides sound footing for an informed approach to the topic.",en,3.95,Social Preconditions of National Revival in Europe : A Comparative Analysis of the Social Composition of Patriotic Groups Among the Smaller European Nations,True,1033

European History,"What induces groups to commit political suicide? This book explores the decisions to surrender power and to legitimate this surrender: collective abdications. Commonsensical explanations impute such actions to coercive pressures, actors' miscalculations, or their contamination by ideologies at odds with group interests. Ivan Ermakoff argues that these explanations are either incomplete or misleading. Focusing on two paradigmatic cases of voluntary and unconditional surrender of power-the passing of an enabling bill granting Hitler the right to amend the Weimar constitution without parliamentary supervision (March 1933), and the transfer of full executive, legislative, and constitutional powers to Marshal Petain (Vichy, France, July 1940)-Ruling Oneself Out recasts abdication as the outcome of a process of collective alignment. Ermakoff distinguishes several mechanisms of alignment in troubled and uncertain times and assesses their significance through a fine-grained examination of actors' beliefs, shifts in perceptions, and subjective states. To this end, he draws on the analytical and methodological resources of perspectives that usually stand apart: primary historical research, formal decision theory, the phenomenology of group processes, quantitative analyses, and the hermeneutics of testimonies. In elaborating this dialogue across disciplinary boundaries, Ruling Oneself Out restores the complexity and indeterminate character of pivotal collective decisions and demonstrates that an in-depth historical exploration can lay bare processes of crucial importance for understanding the formation of political preferences, the paradox of self-deception, and the makeup of historical events as highly consequential.",en,4.5,Ruling Oneself Out : A Theory of Collective Abdications,True,1736

European History,"The first book to offer an integrated reading of ancient Greek attitudes to laughter. Taking material from various genres and contexts, the book analyses both the theory and the practice of laughter as a revealing expression of Greek values and mentalities. Greek society developed distinctive institutions for the celebration of laughter as a capacity which could bridge the gap between humans and gods; but it also feared laughter for its power to expose individuals and groups to shame and even violence. Caught between ideas of pleasure and pain, friendship and enmity, laughter became a theme of recurrent interest in various contexts. Employing a sophisticated model of cultural history, Stephen Halliwell traces elaborations of the theme in a series of important texts: ranging far beyond modern accounts of 'humour', he shows how perceptions of laughter helped to shape Greek conceptions of the body, the mind and the meaning of life.",en,4.27,Greek Laughter : A Study of Cultural Psychology from Homer to Early Christianity,True,942

A historian introduces the topic, evaluating the reliability of the sources.

Legal procedures are inferred from surviving evidence, and the regional economy, based on agriculture and animal husbandry, is reconstructed through the study of vegetable remains and pollen analysis. The birth of urban communities, stimulated by monastic settlements and trade, is followed through archaeological evidence; study of visual art-forms is based on analysis of grave-goods; and in the absence of surviving evidence for poetry, a Carolingian eulogical poem is discussed.

History Of The Americas,"This collection of essays challenges long-entrenched ideas about the history, nature, and significance of the informal neighborhoods that house the vast majority of Latin America's urban poor. Until recently, scholars have mainly viewed these settlements through the prisms of crime and drug-related violence, modernization and development theories, populist or revolutionary politics, or debates about the cultures of poverty. Yet shantytowns have proven both more durable and more multifaceted than any of these perspectives foresaw. Far from being accidental offshoots of more dynamic economic and political developments, they are now a permanent and integral part of Latin America's urban societies, critical to struggles over democratization, economic transformation, identity politics, and the drug and arms trades. Integrating historical, cultural, and social scientific methodologies, this collection brings together recent research from across Latin America, from the informal neighborhoods of Rio de Janeiro and Mexico City, Managua and Buenos Aires.

By emphasizing the interrelationship between practices and ideological change - in family form, religious organization, medical logic, legal structures, and notions of deviancy - Katherine Crawford's accessible survey reveals how these changes produced the conditions in which our modern notions of sexuality were developed.

European History,"This volume contains by far the most complete reports available in English concerning two major terrorist incidents in Russia: the October 2002 seizure of a Moscow theater at Dubrovka and the September 2004 taking of a large school in Beslan in southern Russia. The issues examined are as follows: - the backgrounds of the Muslim extremists who carried out these acts including the de facto leaders of the terrorist assaults, ethnic Chechen Ruslan Elmurzaev and Ingush Ruslan Khuchbarov;- the failure of Russian law-enforcement to prevent these two incidents, documenting both the massive corruption of the Russian security services and police and the absence of the rule of law;- the storming of the Moscow theater building and of the school at Beslan by Russian police, aided by the military, elucidating the reasons for the very large loss of life in both incidents;- the use by the Russian police of a special gas at Dubrovka and of tanks and flamethrowers at Beslan;- the evident fixation of the Putin leadership with portraying these two assaults as incidents of international Islamic terrorism linked to the Al-Qaeda network;- and the repeated attempts on the part of the Russian authorities at the time of these incidents to weaken the influence of moderate Chechen separatists headed by the late Aslan Maskhadov",en,4.66,The 2002 Dubrovka and 2004 Beslan Hostage Crises - A Critique of Russian Counter-Terrorism,True,1320
History Of The Americas,"How did the most powerful nation on earth come to embrace terror as the organizing principle of its security policy? In The Theater of Operations, Joseph Masco locates the origins of the present-day U.S. counterterrorism apparatus in the Cold War's ""balance of terror."" He shows how, after the attacks of 9/11, the U.S. global War on Terror mobilized a wide range of affective, conceptual, and institutional resources established during the Cold War to enable a new planetary theater of operations. Tracing how specific aspects of emotional management, existential danger, state secrecy, and threat awareness have evolved as core aspects of the American social contract, Masco draws on archival, media, and ethnographic resources to offer a new portrait of American national security culture. Undemocratic and unrelenting, this counterterror state prioritizes speculative practices over facts, and ignores everyday forms of violence across climate, capital, and health in an unprecedented effort to anticipate and eliminate terror threats-real, imagined, and emergent.",en,4.22,The Theater of Operations : National Security Affect from the Cold War to the War on Terror,True,1068

History Of The Americas,"From the author of House of Outrageous Fortune For seventy-five years, it's been Manhattan's richest apartment building, and one of the most lusted-after addresses in the world. One apartment had 37 rooms, 14 bathrooms, 43 closets, 11 working fireplaces, a private elevator, and his-and-hers saunas; another at one time had a live-in service staff of 16. To this day, it is steeped in the purest luxury, the kind most of us could only imagine, until now. The last great building to go up along New York's Gold Coast, construction on 740 Park finished in 1930. Since then, 740 has been home to an ever-evolving cadre of our wealthiest and most powerful families, some of America's (and the world's) oldest money--the kind attached to names like Vanderbilt, Rockefeller, Bouvier, Chrysler, Niarchos, Houghton, and Harkness--and some whose names evoke the excesses of today's monied elite: Kravis, Koch, Bronfman, Perelman, Steinberg, and Schwarzman. All along, the building has housed titans of industry, political power brokers, international royalty, fabulous scam-artists, and even the lowest scoundrels. The book begins with the tumultuous story of the building's construction. Conceived in the bubbling financial, artistic, and social cauldron of 1920's Manhattan, 740 Park rose to its dizzying heights as the stock market plunged in 1929--the building was in dire financial straits before the first apartments were sold. The builders include the architectural genius Rosario Candela, the scheming businessman James T. Lee (Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's grandfather), and a raft of financiers, many of whom were little more than white-collar crooks and grand-scale hustlers. Once finished, 740 became a magnet for the richest, oldest families in the country: the Brewsters, descendents of the leader of the Plymouth Colony; the socially-registered Bordens, Hoppins, Scovilles, Thornes, and Schermerhorns; and top executives of the Chase Bank, American Express, and U.S. Rubber. Outside the walls of 740 Park, these were the people shaping America culturally and economically. Within those walls, they were indulging in all of the Seven Deadly Sins. As the social climate evolved throughout the last century, so did 740 Park: after World War II, the building's rulers eased their more restrictive policies and began allowing Jews (though not to this day African Americans) to reside within their hallowed walls. Nowadays, it is full to bursting with new money, people whose fortunes, though freshly-made, are large enough to buy their way in. At its core this book is a social history of the American rich, and how the locus of power and influence has shifted haltingly from old bloodlines to new money. But it's also much more than that: filled with meaty, startling, often tragic stories of the people who lived behind 740's walls, the book gives us an unprecedented access to worlds of wealth, privilege, and extraordinary folly that are usually hidden behind a scrim of money and influence. This is, truly, how the other half--or at least the other one hundredth of one percent--lives.",en,3.31,740 Park : The Story of the World's Richest Apartment Building,True,3090

As the son of a Chicago industrialist with little formal education, Charles R. Crane enjoyed remarkable success serving as a financial backer and advisor to the Woodrow Wilson administration, founding member of the 1917 Root Commission to Russia, minister to China, and establishing a factory in Russia to manufacture air brakes for the Russian railroad.

History Of The Americas,"This book examines the role of the United States of America in the Northern Ireland conflict and peace process.  It begins by looking at how US figures engaged with Northern Ireland, as well as the wider issue of Irish partition, in the years before the outbreak of what became known as the 'Troubles'. From there, it considers early interventions on the part of Congressional figures such as Senator Edward Kennedy and the Congressional hearings on Northern Ireland that took place in the aftermath of Bloody Sunday, 1972. The author then analyses the causes and consequences of the State Department decision to ban the sale of weapons to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, before considering the development of the US role in Northern Ireland through the Reagan administration and the onset of US financial support for conflict resolution in the form of the International Fund for Ireland. The study concludes by assessing the dynamics behind the role that President Clinton assumed following his election in 1992 and examining how Presidents Bush and Obama attempted to capitalize on the momentum of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.",en,,"The Long Peace Process : The United States of America and Northern Ireland, 1960-2008",False,1130

Yet, in the years after 1945, the artisan class became one of the pillars of postwar stability, thoroughly integrated into German society. From Craftsmen to Capitalists gives the first account of this astonishing transformation, exploring how skilled tradesmen recast their historical traditions and forged alliances with former antagonists to help realize German democratization and recovery.",en,,"From Craftsmen to Capitalists : German Artisans from the Third Reich to the Federal Republic, 1939-1953",False,784

History Of The Americas,"small portage.""There the Ojibwe lived in keeping with the seasons, moving among different camps for hunting and fishing, for cultivating and gathering, for harvesting wild rice and maple sugar. In Onigamiising Linda LeGarde Grover accompanies us through this cycle of the seasons, one year in a lifelong journey on the path to Mino Bimaadiziwin, the living of a good life. In fifty short essays, Grover reflects on the spiritual beliefs and everyday practices that carry the Ojibwe through the year and connect them to this northern land of rugged splendor. As the four seasons unfold-from Ziigwan (Spring) through Niibin and Dagwaagin to the silent, snowy promise of Biboon-the award-winning author writes eloquently of the landscape and the weather, work and play, ceremony and tradition and family ways, from the homey moments shared over meals to the celebrations that mark life's great events.

History Of The Americas,"In 9-11, published in November 2001 and arguably the single most influential post 9-11 book, internationally renowned thinker Noam Chomsky bridged the information gap around the World Trade Center attacks, cutting through the tangle of political opportunism, expedient patriotism, and general conformity that choked off American discourse in the months immediately following. Chomsky placed the attacks in context, marshaling his deep and nuanced knowledge of American foreign policy to trace the history of American political aggression--in the Middle East and throughout Latin America as well as in Indonesia, in Afghanistan, in India and Pakistan--at the same time warning against America's increasing reliance on military rhetoric and violence in its response to the attacks, and making the critical point that the mainstream media and public intellectuals were failing to make: any escalation of violence as a response to violence will inevitably lead to further, and bloodier, attacks on innocents in America and around the world. This new edition of 9-11, published on the tenth anniversary of the attacks and featuring a new preface by Chomsky, reminds us that today, just as much as ten years ago, information and clarity remain our most valuable tools in the struggle to prevent future violence against the innocent, both at home and abroad.",en,3.72,9-11 : 10th Anniversary Edition,True,1351

In 9/11, Simpson argues that elements of the conventional culture of mourning and remembrance - grieving the dead, summarizing their lives in obituaries, and erecting monuments in their memory - have been co-opted for political advantage.

More important, postwar monetary relations were not a salve to political tensions, as is often contended. In fact, the politicization of the global payments system allowed nations to use monetary coercion to achieve political and security ends, causing deep conflicts within the Western Alliance. For the first time, Gavin reveals how these rifts dramatically affected U.S. political and military strategy during a dangerous period of the Cold War.",en,4.25,"Gold, Dollars, and Power : The Politics of International Monetary Relations, 1958-1971",True,1132

The common denominator to all essays is the emphasis on the process of remembering in the present, and the modalities by means of which the present perspective shapes processes of remembering, including practices of commemoration and representation of the past. The volume deals with eight major thematic blocks revisiting specific practices in communism such as popular culture and everyday life, childhood, labor, the secret police, and the perception of ""the system"".",en,,Remembering Communism : Private and Public Recollections of Lived Experience in Southeast Europe,False,1014

By showing where that policy proved stabilizing, and where it failed, a nuanced account is provided of how the local structure of the political economy plays a decisive role in shaping outcomes on the ground.",en,3.5,Seeds of Stability : Land Reform and US Foreign Policy,True,772
History Of The Americas,"In the spring of 1837, people panicked as financial and economic uncertainty spread within and between New York, New Orleans and London. Although the period of panic would dramatically influence political, cultural and social history, those who panicked sought to erase from history their experiences of one of America's worst early financial crises. The Many Panics of 1837 reconstructs this period in order to make arguments about the national boundaries of history, the role of information in the economy, the personal and local nature of national and international events, the origins and dissemination of economic ideas, and most importantly, what actually happened in 1837. This riveting transatlantic cultural history, based on archival research on two continents, reveals how people transformed their experiences of financial crisis into the 'Panic of 1837', a single event that would serve as a turning point in American history and an early inspiration for business cycle theory.",en,3.66,"The Many Panics of 1837 : People, Politics, and the Creation of a Transatlantic Financial Crisis",True,989

European History,"There is perhaps nothing so commonplace and yet so mystifying as money. But to European communists, money was clearly an instrument of economic exploitation and spiritual alienation. In this groundbreaking study, Jonathan R. Zatlin explores the East German attempt to create a perfect society by eliminating money and explains the reasons for its failure. Drawing on a wide range of sources, including unpublished communist reports, secret police files, literature, jokes, letters written by ordinary people, and conversations with key German politicians, this book shows how the communist regime undermined the political authority of socialism and created the material conditions for its demise. By exploring both the economic and the cultural function of money, Zatlin challenges traditional approaches to economic planning by offering a novel explanation for the collapse of communism in East Germany and a highly original interpretation of German unification. Written in an engaging and lucid style, The Currency of Socialism brings to life the scurrilous competition for power among communist officials and the everyday burdens experienced by ordinary East Germans.",en,3.88,The Currency of Socialism : Money and Political Culture in East Germany,True,1170
European History,"How and why does Denmark have one of the richest, most equal, and happiest societies in the world today? Historians have often pointed to developments from the late nineteenth century, when small peasant farmers worked together through agricultural cooperatives, whose exports of butter and bacon rapidly gained a strong foothold on the British market. This book presents a radical retelling of this story, placing (largely German-speaking) landed elites--rather than the Danish peasantry--at center stage. After acquiring estates in Denmark, these elites imported and adapted new practices from outside the kingdom, thus embarking on an ambitious program of agricultural reform and sparking a chain of events that eventually led to the emergence of Denmark's famous peasant cooperatives in 1882. A Land of Milk and Butter presents a new interpretation of the origin of these cooperatives with striking implications for developing countries today.",en,,A Land of Milk and Butter : How Elites Created the Modern Danish Dairy Industry,False,947
European History,"As Europe began to grow rich during the Middle Ages, its wealth materialized in the well-made clothes, linens, and wares of ordinary households. In a world without banking, household goods became valuable commodities that often substituted for hard currency. Pawnbrokers and resellers sprung up throughout European cities, helping push these goods into circulation. Simultaneously, a harshly coercive legal system developed to ensure that debtors paid their due.  Legal Plunder explains how the vigorous trade in goods that grew up in fourteenth- and fifteenth-century Europe entangled households in complex relationships of credit and debt. Acting in the interests of creditors, sergeants of the law were empowered to march into debtors' homes and seize belongings equal in value to the debt owed. These officials were cogs in a political machinery of state-sponsored plunder. As Daniel Smail shows, one of the common activities of medieval law courts was debt recovery, and court records offer some of the most vivid descriptions of material culture in this period, providing insight into the lives of men and women living in a world on the cusp of modern capitalism.",en,,Legal Plunder : Households and Debt Collection in Late Medieval Europe,False,1169

Dr Pollard, a leading historian of the modern papacy, shows how until 1929 the papacy was largely funded by 'Peter's Pence' collected from the faithful, and from the residue the Vatican made its first capitalistic investments, especially in the ill-fated Banco di Roma. After 1929, the Vatican received much of its income from the investments made by the banker Bernadino Nogara in world markets and commercial enterprises. This process of coming to terms with capitalism was arguably in conflict both with Church law and Catholic social teaching and becoming a major financial power led the Vatican into conflict with the Allies during the Second World War. In broader terms, the ways in which the papacy financed itself helped shape the overall development of the modern papacy.",en,4.0,"Money and the Rise of the Modern Papacy : Financing the Vatican, 1850-1950",True,876

Disabled but still productive factory workers were being fired, and developmentally disabled individuals who had previously contributed domestic or agricultural labor in homes or on farms were being sent to institutions and poorhouses. In this book, Sarah F.

Drawing on archival sources, Ames offers a new interpretation of France's mercantilism in the context of the rise of the world market economy of the early modern period.

However, in spite of the great upheavals and achievements of Atlantic plantation, this ambition would never be fulfilled. By taking the commercial failure of silk seriously and examining numerous experiments across New Spain, New France, British North America and the early United States, Ben Marsh reveals new insights into aspiration, labour, environment, and economy in these societies. Each devised its own dreams and plans of cultivation, framed by the particularities of cultures and landscapes. Writ large, these dreams would unravel one by one: the attempts to introduce silkworms across the Atlantic world ultimately constituted a step too far, marking out the limits of Europeans' seemingly unbounded power.",en,,"Unravelled Dreams : Silk and the Atlantic World, 1500-1840",False,994

From the talented Lisa Gardiner comes a novel packed with magic, alpha male dominance, explosive passion and suspense. *Like 50 shades on acid- Good Reads review *Well worth the read- Ashley Lister MMF paranormal romance, BBW romance, Bisexual menage romance, sexy Christmas romance, fairy tale. It's a lovely night for a sleigh ride- until something wicked takes the reins. When Nick and Kris, the half-fae sons of human mothers, aren't using Santa's sleigh in the off-season to make deliveries for their booming sex toy business, they're setting off sensual fireworks in the bedroom. Yet they dream of a feminine third to complete their lives. There's only one woman they can picture filling that role: Lilly, the girl they both dated in college. Lilly thought earning extra money stripping was a good plan, until she's left battered, bruised, and stuffed in a back-alley trash can. Her rescuers turn out to be the dark, brooding Dom and the golden-haired sub whose faces-and shockingly entwined bodies-are still the stuff of her most searing fantasies. While she's more than willing to take them up on their offer of one perfect night of magic, she questions whether anyone can break into Nick and Kris's powerful bond. But there's someone who's been waiting for this moment all Lilly's life. An evil psychopath who holds the secrets of her past-unless Nick and Kris can unravel them in time to save her from a fate worse than death.

History Of The Americas,"This book examines the clothing worn by African Americans in the southern United States during the thirty years before the American Civil War. Drawing on a wide range of sources, most notably oral narratives recorded in the 1930s, this rich account shows that African Americans demonstrated a thorough knowledge of the role clothing played in demarcating age, sex, status, work, recreation, as well as special secular and sacred events. Testimonies offer proof of African Americans' vast technical skills in producing cloth and clothing, which served both as a fundamental reflection of the peoples' Afrocentric craftsmanship and aesthetic sensibilities, and as a reaction to their particular place in American society. Previous work on clothing in this period has tended to focus on white viewpoints, and as a consequence the dress worn by the enslaved has generally been seen as a static standard imposed by white overlords. This excellent study departs from conventional interpretations to show that the clothing of the enslaved changed over time, served multiple functions and represented customs and attitudes which evolved distinctly from within African American communities.",en,4.5,New Raiments of Self : African American Clothing in the Antebellum South,True,1181

History Of The Americas,"Merchants, Markets, and Exchange in the Pre-Columbian World examines the structure, scale, and complexity of economic systems in the pre-Hispanic Americas, with a focus on the central highlands of Mexico, the Maya Lowlands, and the central Andes. Civilization in each region was characterized by complex political and religious institutions, highly skilled craft production, and the long-distance movement of finished goods. Scholars have long focused on the differences in economic organization between these civilizations. Societies in the Mexican highlands are recognized as having a highly commercial economy centered around one of the world's most complex market systems; those of the Maya region are characterized as having reciprocal exchange networks and periodic marketplaces that supplemented the dominant role of the palace; and those of the central Andes are recognized as having multiple forms of resource distribution, including household-to-household reciprocity, barter, environmental complementarity, and limited market exchange. Essays in this volume examine various dimensions of these ancient economies, including the presence of marketplaces, the operation of merchants (and other individuals) who exchanged and moved goods across space, the role of artisans who produced goods as part of their livelihood, and the trade and distribution networks through which goods were bought, sold, and exchanged.",en,4.0,"Merchants, Markets, and Exchange in the Pre-Columbian World",True,1421

Major Stephen H.

John Tanner, a ""white Indian"" living among the Ojibwa nation, arrived in search of his missing daughters, who, Tanner believed, were at risk of being raped by the white traders holding them captive at a nearby fort.

European History,"The 2008 financial crisis led to more and more frequent political attacks on central banks. The recent spotlight on central bank independence is reminiscent of the fiery debates amongst Germany's political elites in 1949 on the same issue; debates that were sparked by the establishment of West Germany in that year. Simon Mee shows how, with the establishment of West Germany's central bank - today's Deutsche Bundesbank - the country's monetary history became a political football, as central bankers, politicians, industrialists and trade unionists all vied for influence over the legal provisions that set out the remit of the future monetary authority. The author reveals how a specific version of inter-war history, one that stresses the lessons learned from Germany's periods of inflation, was weaponised and attached to a political, contemporary argument for an independent central bank. The book challenges assumptions around the evolution of central bank independence with continued relevance today.",en,,Central Bank Independence and the Legacy of the German Past,False,1009

Starting in the late eighteenth century, merchants from New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Salem, Newport, and elsewhere cast speculative lines to China. The resulting fortunes shaped the cultural foundation of the early republic and funded westward frontier expansion. In  The New Middle Kingdom, Kendall A. Johnson argues that-for the merchant princes who speculated in the global Far East, as well as the missionaries and diplomats who followed them-Manifest Destiny spurred more than the coalescence of the fractious regions into the continental Far West. It also promised a golden gateway to the Pacific Ocean through which the nation would realize its historical destiny as the world's new Middle Kingdom of commerce. Examining the influential accounts of westerners at the center of early US cultural development abroad, Johnson conceives a romance of free trade with China as a quest narrative of national accomplishment in a global marketplace.",en,4.0,The New Middle Kingdom : China and the Early American Romance of Free Trade,True,1138

Reference Works,"The Military Services received a total of 6,083 reports of sexual assault involving Service members as either victims or subjects throughout fiscal year 2015, which represents a 1% decrease from the reports made in fiscal year 2014.1 Although many of these reports were for incidents that occurred in fiscal year 2015, some incidents occurred in prior years. Of the 6,083 reports of sexual assault, 5,240 were Service member victims who made a report. Of those 5,240 Service member victims, 504 victims (approximately 10%) made a report for incidents that occurred before they entered into Military Service. The United States military allows victims to make Unrestricted or Restricted Reports of sexual assault. The Military Services received 4,584 Unrestricted Reports involving Service members as either victims or subjects, a 2% decrease from fiscal year 2014. The Military Services initially received 1,900 Restricted Reports involving Service members as either victims or subjects. Four hundred and one (21%) of the initial Restricted Reports later converted to Unrestricted Reports. These 401 converted Restricted Reports are now counted with the Unrestricted Reports. Of the initial Restricted Reports, 1,499 reports remained Restricted at the end of fiscal year 2015, a 2% increase from fiscal year 2014. The Services do not investigate Restricted Reports and do not record the identities of alleged perpetrators. The Department takes appropriate action in every case where it has jurisdiction. This year, the Department had jurisdiction to take some kind of disciplinary action against 72% of military subjects. Disciplinary action was not possible for the remaining 28% of military subjects due to evidentiary or other legal factors, such as unfounded by command/legal review, victim declined to participate, insufficient evidence, statute of limitations expired, or victim died before completion of the military justice action. Appendices B and C of this report detail sexual assault data from fiscal year 2015. The major survey conducted in fiscal year 2015 was the Workplace and Gender Relations Survey for Reserve Component Members; results can be found in Annex 1 of this report. A survey to estimate fiscal year 2015 sexual assault prevalence for the Active Duty Force was not conducted this year as it is only collected on a biennial basis pursuant to Section 481 of Title 10 United States Code. Last year's survey results, however, indicated that the estimated prevalence of sexual assault within the Military Services decreased significantly for women and trended downward for men, when compared to estimated prevalence rates measured in fiscal year 2012. The Department will conduct a survey this coming fiscal year and its results will be included in the fiscal year 2016 Annual Report to update estimated prevalence rates for the Active Duty Force.",en,,Department of Defense Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military Fiscal Year 2015,False,2870

Entertaining more than a million people a year in the 1980s, the New Jersey-based amusement playland placed no limits on danger or fun, a monument to the anything-goes spirit of the era that left guests in control of their own adventures--sometimes with tragic results. Though it closed its doors in 1996 after nearly twenty years, it has remained a subject of constant fascination ever since, an establishment completely anathema to our modern culture of rules and safety. Action Park is the first-ever unvarnished look at the history of this DIY Disneyland, as seen through the eyes of Andy Mulvihill, the son of the park's idiosyncratic founder, Gene Mulvihill. From his early days testing precarious rides to working his way up to chief lifeguard of the infamous Wave Pool to later helping run the whole park, Andy's story is equal parts hilarious and moving, chronicling the life and death of a uniquely American attraction, a wet and wild 1980s adolescence, and a son's struggle to understand his father's quixotic quest to become the Walt Disney of New Jersey. Packing in all of the excitement of a day at Action Park, this is destined to be one of the most unforgettable memoirs of the year.",en,3.95,Action Park,True,1543

Poetry By Individual Poets,"Sonosyntactics introduces the reader to over forty-five years of Paul Dutton's diverse and inventive poetry, ranging from lyrics, prose poems, and visual work to performance texts and scores. Perhaps best known for his acclaimed solo sound performances and his contributions to the iconic sound poetry group The Four Horsemen, Dutton is a surprising, witty, sensitive, and innovative explorer of language and of the human. This volume gathers a representative selection of his most significant and characteristic poetry together with a generous selection of uncollected new work. Sonosyntactics demonstrates Dutton's willingness to (re)invent and stretch language and to listen for new possibilities while at the same time engaging with his perennial concernsalove, sex, music, time, thought, humour, the materiality of language, and poetry itself. Gary Barwin's introduction outlines the major subjects and techniques of Dutton's poetry: an intricate weaving of thought and language, sound and emotion, sound and sense, and the unfolding of a text through the logic of language play such as puns, paradoxes, ambiguity, and sound relations. In an afterword by Dutton himself, the poet insightfully lays out the terms of his engagement with the materialityaboth visual and auralaof language, often beyond the purely recountable, representational, or depictive.",en,4.66,Sonosyntactics : Selected and New Poetry of Paul Dutton,True,1359

European History,"This book provides a stimulating overview of twentieth-century German art, focusing on some of the period's key works by Max Beckmann, George Grosz, Hannah Hoch, Willi Baumeister, Arno Breker, Joseph Beuys, and Gerhard Richter. In Peter Chametzky's innovative approach, these works become representatives rather than representations of twentieth-century history. That is, the art here does not simply illustrate an argument, the art is the argument. Chametzky draws on both scholarly and popular sources to demonstrate how the works (and in some cases, the artists themselves) interacted with, and even enacted, historical events, processes, and ideas. He asserts the continued historical role of material art works in an era when less material forms - photography, film, television, video, digital images - have assumed the function of visually depicting contemporary history.",en,5.0,Objects as History in Twentieth-Century German Art : Beckmann to Beuys,True,877

This is the first book in English about Caesarius, and the only book to discuss southern Gaul during the sixth century. It examines afresh the crucial years of continuity, disruption, and profound change which followed the end of the Roman empire in the west, and the effects of Caesarius' programme under the later Merovingians and Carolingians.",en,4.4,Caesarius of Arles : The Making of a Christian Community in Late Antique Gaul,True,783

Such brilliance does not develop in a vacuum, and Rohmer cultivated a fascinating network of friends, colleagues, and industry contacts that kept his outlook sharp and propelled his work forward. Despite his privacy, he cared deeply about politics, religion, culture, and fostering a public appreciation of the medium he loved. This exhaustive biography uses personal archives and interviews to enrich our knowledge of Rohmer's public achievements and lesser known interests and relations. The filmmaker kept in close communication with his contemporaries and competitors: Francois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, and Jacques Rivette.

Graphic Novels: Manga,"Gen y sus amigos tienen que afrontar las secuelasde la bomba, una realidad casi imposible de aceptar.

Mientras los soldados patrullan, en las calles de Hiroshima aún se pueden oír los gemidos de dolor y el llanto de los supervivientes. Para la mayoría de esa gente la guerra todavía no ha terminado. Conviven con ella. La ven cada vez que se miran en el espejo, como Natsue, que tiene el rostro quemado. Gen por su parte, ve como muchos de sus amigos se han quedado huérfanos y corren peligro de caer en manos de los yakuza. Ya ha perdido a uno de ellos, a Bellota, y no permitirá que a Ryuta y a los demás les pase lo mismo. Quiere alejarles del peligro, pero él también tiene sus propios problemas: su madre está muy enferma como consecuencia de la radiación. El segundo volumen de Pies Descalzos, uno de los mejores cómics de la historia. Estoy seguro de que Nakazawa se convertirá en uno de los grandes artistas del cómic del siglo. ENGLISH DESCRIPTION This compelling autobiography tells the life story of famed manga artist Nakazawa Keiji. Born in Hiroshima in 1939, Nakazawa was six years old when on August 6, 1945, the United States dropped the atomic bomb. His gritty and stunning account of the horrific aftermath is powerfully told through the eyes of a child who lost most of his family and neighbors. In eminently readable and beautifully translated prose, the narrative continues through the brutally difficult years immediately after the war, his art apprenticeship in Tokyo, his pioneering ""atomic-bomb"" manga, and the creation of Barefoot Gen, the classic graphic novel based on Nakazawa's experiences before, during, and after the bomb. This first English-language translation of Nakazawa's autobiography includes twenty pages of excerpts from Barefoot Gen to give readers who don't know the manga a taste of its power and scope. A recent interview with the author brings his life up to the present. His trenchant hostility to Japanese imperialism, the emperor and the emperor system, and U.S. policy adds important nuance to the debate over Hiroshima. Despite the grimness of his early life, Nakazawa never succumbs to pessimism or defeatism. His trademark optimism and activism shine through in this inspirational work.",es,4.33,Pies Descalzos 2 / Barefoot Gen 2,True,2355

Reference Works,"The theoretical framework for this book was our ground-up theory of the Scope, Size, Speed, and Skill (4Ss) and Technological Situational Happenstances (TSHs) applied to Big data analytics. With in-depth research, we catechized the effects of the coalesced insights from big data influencing the architectures of incremental and radical business models. We discussed data inflation and the global impact of TSHs. We showed how deft leadership used insights gleaned from big data analytics to make strategic decisions. The big data syndrome led to Microsoft's acquisition of Nokia in our case study. Our study of APPLE Corporation's use of large datasets was explicitly analyzed. Leaderships' failure to incorporate those contextual elements afforded by insights gleaned from big data analytics, concomitant with the associated costs led to acute forms of irrational rationalism, groupthink, and faulty decision making. We explained the statistics used to essentially describe this paradigm shift, such as high dimensionality, incidental endogeneity, noise accumulation, spurious correlation, and computational costs. Significantly, machine learning challenged the status quo by effectively changing the existing technological landscape. To scholarly critics, how would supervised and un-supervised learning algorithms advance the trajectory of perspectives in applied knowledge under the umbrella of big data? Further, political and socio-economics tied to big data was examined. We recommended leaders should have a shared cognition on how to leverage analytics from large datasets for competitive advantages. Most significantly, leaders or managers should be cognizant of the inextricable synergies that seamlessly flow from adroitly implementing a strategy to profit from the speed, size, skill, and scope (i.e. the 4Ss) of the big data environment, conditioned by the leveraging of those transactional situational happenstances generated by increases in market volatility.

Reference Works,"To buy this book, please send email to: globalbooksellers@gmail.com degarandishanpublication@gmail.com The diesel engine is a compression-ignition internal combustion heat engine which can be operated in both the four- and two-stroke cycle. This high efficiency translates to good fuel economy and low greenhouse gas emissions. Pressure charging is the process of force-feeding air into the combustion chamber of the diesel engine. All marine propulsion diesel engines have an air-charge system with an exhaust driven turbine. This is referred to as turbocharging. A modern turbocharger has simple, modular design, aimed at improving overall life cycle. Developments in turbocharger's component design and manufacture all contribute to this goal. The key design criteria include: -High specific flow rates -High efficiencies and reliability -Low noise emissions -Ease of maintenance and mounting -Long-service life When comparing similar rated engines, in terms of environmental protection, one fitted with a modern turbocharger will consume some 10-15% less fuel while reducing gaseous emissions by equally significant amounts. However it is not just in fuel efficiency where environmental protection benefits lie, in noise and vibration for example, modern turbocharger has succeeded in lowering noise emissions to less than at one meter distance and has improved vibration characteristics, by having kept the natural frequencies well above any exciting frequencies from the diesel engine. In connection with turbocharger matching to marine propulsion diesel engine, years of experience have enabled makers of turbocharger to develop a simple, semi-empirical method for selecting the optimum turbocharger for any propulsion engine, turbocharging system, output data and ambient conditions, at low computation cost and with sufficient accuracy. The calculation of turbocharging system with pulsating admission of the turbine is based on an empirical 'pulse factor' and can thus be reduced to a simple computation of a system with 'equivalent constant-pressure admission' of the turbine. All the empirical characteristic variables are so defined that they can be determined from the usual, available numerical data from acceptance tests and turbocharger adaptation tests, and also by step-by-step computation of real working cycle.",en,,Selection and Matching Turbocharger to Large Propulsion Engine Performance,False,2331

European History,"The turn of the eighteenth century was a period of transition in France, a time when new but contested concepts of modernity emerged in virtually every cultural realm. The rigidity of the state's consolidation of the arts in the late seventeenth century yielded to a more vibrant and diverse cultural life, and Paris became, once again, the social and artistic capital of the wealthiest nation in Europe. In Sheltering Art, Rochelle Ziskin explores private art collecting, a primary facet of that newly decentralized artistic realm and one increasingly embraced by an expanding social elite as the century wore on. During the key period when Paris reclaimed its role as the nexus of cultural and social life, two rival circles of art collectors-with dissonant goals and disparate conceptions of modernity-competed for preeminence. Sheltering Art focuses on these collectors, their motivations for collecting art, and the natures of their collections. An ambitious study, it employs extensive archival research in its examination of the ideologies associated with different strategies of collecting in eighteenth-century Paris and how art collecting was inextricably linked to the shaping of social identities.",en,4.0,Sheltering Art : Collecting and Social Identity in Early Eighteenth-Century Paris,True,1209

European History,"Landscapes across Europe were transformed, both physically and conceptually, during the early medieval period (c AD 400-1200), and these changes were bound up with the conversion to Christianity and the development of ecclesiastical power structures. Whilst Christianity represented a more or less common set of beliefs and ideas, early medieval societies were characterised by vibrant diversity: much can potentially be learned about these societies by comparing and contrasting how they adapted Christianity to suit local circumstances. This is the first book to adopt a comparative landscape approach to this crucial subject. It considers the imprint of early medieval Christianity on landscapes along the continent's western shore from Galicia to Norway, and across the northern islands from Britain and Ireland to Iceland. The construction of new monuments clearly led to some major physical changes, but landscapes are not just affected by tangible, material alterations: they are also shaped by new types of knowledge and changing perceptions.Christianity was associated with many such changes including new ways of seeing the land that directly affected how landscapes were inhabited and managed.",en,5.0,Making Christian Landscapes in Atlantic Europe : Conversion and Consolidation in the Early Middle Ages,True,1204

Whereas scholars have traditionally focused on the creation of these works, Rachel Kousser instead draws on archaeological and textual sources to analyze the later histories of these sculptures, reconstructing the processes of damage and reparation that characterized the lives of Greek images. Using an approach informed by anthropology and iconoclasm studies, Kousser describes how damage to sculptures took place within a broader cultural context. She also tracks the development of an anti-iconoclastic discourse in Hellenic society from the Persian wars to the death of Cleopatra. Her study offers a fresh perspective on the role of the image in ancient Greece. It also sheds new light on the creation of Hellenic cultural identity and the formation of collective memory in the Classical and Hellenistic eras.",en,,"The Afterlives of Greek Sculpture : Interaction, Transformation, and Destruction",False,953

European History,"Albrecht Durer (1471-1528) was hailed in his lifetime as a founder of the Northern Renaissance, and his work revolutionized the art of printmaking. Durer was also the first artist outside Italy to leave behind a large body of writing. Contemporaries and succeeding generations added their accounts of him to this documentary legacy. Jeffrey Ashcroft's new book provides the first English translation of the whole corpus of Durer's writings; the legal, financial, and administrative documentation of his life and work; and what others wrote about him during his life and in the following century. Translations of primary documents are accompanied by extensive commentary, providing Anglophone scholars access to German-language research. This unique combination of documentary evidence, current research, and exhaustive bibliography will doubtless become a definitive source for students and scholars of Durer and his work, as well as for historians of early modern culture, language, and literature.",en,,Albrecht Durer : Documentary Biography,False,999

Persons granted asylum applied either at a port of entry or at some point after their entry into the United States.

The principal text is the first English translation of Roché's novel Victor, an account of his friendship with Duchamp (nicknamed Victor by his close friends in those days). Although unfinished, Roché's text offers a unique account of New York Dada, all of whose principal characters and events make an appearance: Francis Picabia, Arthur Cravan, the Arensbergs and their soirées, the Blind Man's Ball and the scandal of Duchamp's ""Fountain"" at the Independents exhibition, a pivotal moment in modern art. The novel offers interesting insights into the sexual politics of the period, when a woman could be arrested or blackmailed for spending the night with a man to whom she was not married. Roché, a lifelong friend of Duchamp, appears to have been something of a devotee of triangular relationships, and went on to write a more famous novel on the topic (also autobiographical), Jules et Jim--later made into a film by François Truffaut. Beatrice Wood's account of these events is taken from her memoirs; she went on to become a celebrated ceramicist, dying in 1998 aged 105.

James I's peace treaty with Spain in 1604 rendered travel to Catholic Europe both safer and more respectable than it had been under the Tudors and opened up the continent to a new generation of aristocratic explorers, enquirers and adventurers. This book examines the political and cultural significance of the encounters that resulted, focusing in particular on two of England's greatest, and newly united, families: the Cecils and the Howards.

Easy-wear materials were adapted for producing more formal clothes, and versatile separates and adaptable dress and jacket suits became hallmarks of American style.

European History,"This book is the first study of the portico and its decorative program as a cultural phenomenon in Renaissance Italy. Focusing on a largely neglected group of porticoes decorated with painted pergolas that appeared in Rome and environs in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, it tells the story of how an element of the garden-the pergola-became a pictorial topos in portico decoration, and evolved, hand in hand with its real cousin in the garden, into an object for cultural emulation among the educated patrons of early modern Rome. The liminality of both the portico and the pergola at the interface of architecture and garden is key to the interpretation of these architectural and painted forms, which rests on the intersecting frameworks of the classical tradition, natural history, and the cultural identity of the aristocracy. In the mediating space of the Renaissance portico, the illusionism pergola created an art gallery, a natural history museum, and a virtual garden where one could engage in leisurely strolls, learned conversations, appreciation of art, and scientific investigation, as well as extensive travel across time and space. The book proposes the interpretation that the illusionistic pergola was an artistic formula for the early modern perception of nature.",en,,Renaissance Porticoes and Painted Pergolas : Nature and Culture in Early Modern Italy,False,1296

European History,"War movies have long been the most influential genre in Russian cinema, so much so that in the Soviet Union's militaristic society, """"cinema front"""" was used to describe the film industry itself. Denise J. Youngblood, an internationally recognized authority on Russian and Soviet cinema, provides the first comprehensive guide to this long-neglected genre. Youngblood explores more than 160 fiction films on Russian conflicts from World War I to Chechnya. These movies represent a wide range of cinematic styles and critical receptions. While not ignoring classic war films like """"Chapaev"""" and """"The Cranes Are Flying"""", Youngblood introduces readers to the films that shaped and reflected Soviet views of war, like the rousing World War II favorite """"Two Warriors"""", the Thaw classic """"The Living and the Dead"""", and the Brezhnevian extravaganza """"Liberation"""". This remarkably humanistic body of work was often at odds with official policies and depicted the futility of war. Youngblood is especially insightful regarding the relationship between Stalinism, Socialist Realism, and filmmakers in creating the war film genre during an era marked by increasing militarization, conformism, and state terror and by the importance of cinema in the World War II propaganda effort. Stalin's obsession with movies led to the """"revisioning"""" of his role in the Civil War and the """"Great Patriotic War."""" Yet, Youngblood argues, Soviet filmmakers were not mere puppets of repressive regimes. Indeed, some filmmakers subtly subverted official politics and history in the guise of art or Hollywood-style entertainment. She brings the story to the present by showing how post-Soviet Russian filmmakers have not only turned a critical eye on the recent wars in Afghanistan and Chechnya but are also revisiting the complex realities of World War II. Youngblood tells a fascinating story that will appeal equally to film aficionados and history buffs. By tracing the evolution of cinema through the twists and turns of both Soviet and post-Soviet society, she helps us understand the role movies played in 20th-century Russia, not only in the making and unmaking of political myths but also in the """"writing"""" of history.",en,4.0,"Russian War Films : On the Cinema Front, 1914-2005",True,2207

Most prominent are the accounts of Anglo-American expansionism and Manifest Destiny juxtaposed with the Chicano nationalist tale of Aztlan in the twentieth century, all constituting collective, contending claims to the U.S. Southwest. Demonstrating how stories can become vehicles for reshaping places and identities, Price considers characters old and new who inhabit the contemporary borderlands between Mexico and the United States-ranging from longstanding manifestations of good and evil in the figures of the Virgin of Guadalupe and the Devil to a collection of lay saints embodying current concerns.

History Of The Americas,"By 1860, in the state of Mississippi, there were 353,899 whites and 437,404 African Americans, of which less than 1,000 were free. Claiborne County, located in the southwestern part of the state on the Mississippi River, was an integral piece of the Cotton Kingdom. Ms. Terry has made every effort to be as comprehensive as possible, providing information not only on Claiborne County's African American slaves and their descendants but on the European American slave owners and their descendants as well. The author presents the data in a clear, concise, easy-to-read format. The first chapter consists of names gathered from Will Book A, 1804-1833. The names are sequenced by the slave's first name and also includes the names of the owners, the date the will was written, the owner's heirs, each heir's relationship to the owner, the page number that the will appears on in Will Book A, and the slave's spouse, children and siblings, if applicable. Some entries also have notes concerning further bequeathals, names of the will trustees, etc. Chapter Two consists of data compiled from the Port Gibson Property List, 1846-1858, and documents the slave's first name, the owner's names (both husband and wife), the slave's age, the date the information was recorded, and the slave's parents and siblings, if applicable. Additional notes here, again, concern further bequeathals, names of the will trustees, etc. The final chapter focuses on information found in Certificates for Slave Sales, 1858-1860. Here the author found slaves who had been purchased in Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee who were then taken to Claiborne County to be sold. The information consists of the slave's name, the trader, the city or county and state from which the slave was purchased, and the slave's age (when provided); some entries include the name of the owner. The book also contains a list of witnesses to wills found in Will Book A and an every-name index that allows the reader to search for names by the owner's and relative's last name in addition to the slave's and relative's first names.

Drew Philp, an idealistic college student from a working-class Michigan family, decides to live where he can make a difference. He sets his sights on Detroit, the failed metropolis of abandoned buildings, widespread poverty, and rampant crime. Arriving with no job, no friends, and no money, Philp buys a ramshackle house for five hundred dollars in the east side neighborhood known as Poletown. The roomy Queen Anne he now owns is little more than a clapboard shell on a crumbling brick foundation, missing windows, heat, water, electricity, and a functional roof. A $500 House in Detroit is Philp's raw and earnest account of rebuilding everything but the frame of his house, nail by nail and room by room. ""Philp is a great storyteller...[and his] engrossing"" (Booklist) tale is also of a young man finding his footing in the city, the country, and his own generation. We witness his concept of Detroit shift, expand, and evolve as his plan to save the city gives way to a life forged from political meaning, personal connection, and collective purpose. As he assimilates into the community of Detroiters around him, Philp guides readers through the city's vibrant history and engages in urgent conversations about gentrification, racial tensions, and class warfare.

European History,"The quest to create a decent world, to maintain a clean environment, and to nurture a self-renewing inheritance to pass on to future generations is not unique to the twentieth-century. Rather, as Ronald Zupko and Robert Laures show in this fascinating study of medieval environmental attitudes and regulations, it has been the recurring dream of men and women for centuries.The history of the medieval towns of northern and central Italy opens a window onto the concerns of urban elites throughout the medieval world regarding the environment and quality of life. In Straws in the Wind, the authors demonstrate that legislative efforts to control the environment were neither haphazard nor accidental. Rather, they were rational responses to perceived needs, often based on a valuable store of knowledge inherited from their Roman forebears.Zupko and Laures describe who these early environmentalists were, what motivated them, how they shaped the environmental programs they devised, and how they implemented and enforced these regulations. The book examines the efforts of town officials, often acting independently of powerful regional, papal, and imperial authorities, to provide their citizens with the best possible urban quality of life?within the limits of their knowledge, experience, and technology. Moreover, Zupko and Laures reveal evidence of grassroots support for the protection of resources and for the preservation of air, water, and the aesthetic qualities of the urban environment. The results of these efforts, when compared to those of the modern environmental movement, were very modest, merely ?Straws in the Wind.? Nonetheless, they were the harbingers of the future.",en,3.75,Straws In The Wind : Medieval Urban Environmental Law--the Case Of Northern Italy,True,1691

European History,"""Describes with plenty of colour how surrealism, from Rene Magritte's bowler hats to Salvador Dali's watches, was born and developed."" - The Times (UK) As she did for the Modernists In Montmartre, noted art historian and biographer Sue Roe now tells the story of the Surrealists in Montparnasse.  In Montparnasse begins on the eve of the First World War and ends with the 1936 unveiling of Dalí's Lobster Telephone. As those extraordinary years unfolded, the Surrealists found ever more innovative ways of exploring the interior life, and asking new questions about how to define art. In Montparnasse recounts how this artistic revolution came to be amidst the salons and cafés of that vibrant neighborhood.  Sue Roe is both an incisive art critic of these pieces and a beguiling biographer with a fingertip feel for this compelling world. Beginning with Duchamp, Roe then takes us through the rise of the Dada movement, the birth of Surrealist photography with Man Ray, the creation of key works by Ernst, Cocteau, and others, through the arrival of Dalí. On canvas and in their readymades and other works these artists juxtaposed objects never before seen together to make the viewer marvel at the ordinary--and at the workings of the subconscious. We see both how this art came to be and how the artists of Montparnasse lived. Roe puts us with Gertrude Stein in her box seat at the opening of The Rite of Spring; with Duchamp as he installs his famous urinal; at a Cocteau theatrical with Picasso and Coco Chanel; with Breton at a session with Freud; and with Man Ray as he romances Kiki de Montparnasse.  Stein said it best when she noted that the Surrealists still saw in the common ways of the 19th century, but they complicated things with the bold new vision of the 20th. Their words mark an enormously important watershed in the history of art--and they forever changed the way we all see the world.",en,3.82,"In Montparnasse : The Emergence of Surrealism in Paris, from Duchamp to Dali",True,1908

But for a fan like Julie Hamill, of thirty years, it's hard not to want to know everything about him, the truth, not the fair-weather and often blackened portrayals of him in the press. These fans want to know for themselves: Who is Morrissey? What does he really talk about? What does he eat? How does he take his tea? What makes him laugh? Is he like me? Not wanting to intrude, or rummage through his bins, Julie simply wanted to know how human he is, because she knows she will never get that close to this genius that has been a constant in her life, both in terms of lyrical comfort, fascination and awe. Each interview led Julie to discover more than just how deeply people felt connected to Morrissey. She discovered more about each one as a person too. Their favourite things, what makes them tick, and out of one simple request to Mark Nevin for an autograph for her mum, Julie also ended up with a special collection of notes from all the contributors to her mum.

European History,"The destruction on the morning of All Saints Day 1755 of the heart of the city of Lisbon by an earthquake, tidal wave and the urban fires that followed was a tragedy that divides the 18th century in Portugal. One casualty on that fatal morning was the Royal Library, one of the most magnificent libraries in Europe at the time. The Lost Library of the King of Portugal tells the story of the lost library - its creation, collection and significance. This 18th-century library was founded by the Bragança monarch Dom João V shortly after he came to the throne in 1706, and was housed at the heart of the royal palace, the Paço da Ribeira in Lisbon. The king's abiding ambition was to create one of Europe's great court libraries and, at the time of his death in 1750, it was reputed to be one of the most magnificent libraries in Europe. The Royal Library was also composed of a Cabinet of Prints and Drawings, medals and scientific instruments as well as a Cabinet of Natural History with specimens from across Portugal's global empire.This documented study describes the creation of the library, its cultural significance in 18th-century Portugal, the acquisition of single volumes as well as entire libraries from across Europe and the role in this of Portugal's most talented diplomats. It include the collection of manuscripts from the celebrated library of Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland and the unpublished correspondence that was exchanged during the negotiations between London and Lisbon. Throughout his reign, the devout Dom João V set out to conjure up his own vision of Rome and the papal court he never saw. Two chapters are devoted to Italy - one to the talented archaeologist Francesco Bianchini at the papal court, including the unpublished correspondence between him and his royal patron Dom João V, as well as the guides to Rome and art and architecture at the ducal courts of northern Italy, both commissioned by the king. When the library was destroyed in 1 November 1755 by the earthquake, tidal wave and the fires that followed, only a few books, manuscripts and albums of prints were saved, and the author traces their final journey with the royal family and court to Brazil on the eve of the invasion by Napoleon's army in November 1806.",en,,The Lost Library of the King of Portugal,False,2270

However did we get from those forms of trial to trial by jury? We take trial by jury as a given, but why is it enshrined in the Bill of Rights? In this book you will ?nd out.

History Of The Americas,"The Eighth AmendmentExcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.Today, our interest in cruel and unusual punishment centers on the death penalty. But, as made clear in this book, it has been viewed with different perspective in different ages. Medieval Christians saw the death penalty as a means of obtaining Gods grace and treated execution with reverence whereas earlier, and later generations saw it as a correction to vice and deterrent to others. Rarely has it been seen as retribution. And although the Framers wording, with a one word exception, is copied from the English Bill of Rights of 1689, the Framers were working with a different premise  an evolving notion of crime, proportionality and punishment. In this book, Robert McWhirter traces the complicated history that led to the juxtaposition of cruel and punishment in the Eighth Amendment from early Judaic law to the present day. This lively account is written for the interested citizen, as well as the civics student. Along the way there are surprising, and interesting, discursions into how the events and personalities surrounding the Eighth Amendment have appeared in literature, film, sports and popular culture.

It is used almost thirty times in connection with the tabernacle in the wilderness and the temple of Jerusalem-always referring to some action the priest carried out in its courtyard or in the holy place. The question, then, is what single word or phrase can encompass all of these regular priestly activities in both areas? The ""daily,"" which was followed once a year by the ""yearly"" or ""annual"" ministration in the Most Holy Place.

European History,"Despite the massive influx of Hollywood movies and films from other European countries after World War II, Austrian film continued to be hugely popular with Austrian and German audiences. By examining the decisive role that popular cinema played in the turbulent post-war era, this book provides unique insights into the reconstruction of a disrupted society. Issues of masculinity and national identity were particularly pressing, either because they had come under severe pressure, as was the case with masculinity, or had to be newly formulated and asserted in order to guarantee Austria's national independence; they provide the lens through which Austrian cinema is examined. Through detailed analysis of the stylistic patterns, narratives, and major themes of four popular genres of the time, costume film, Heimatfilm, tourist film, and comedy, the book explains how popular cinema helped to shape national identity, smoothed conflicted gender relations and relieved the Austrians from the burden of the Nazi past through celebrating the harmonious, charming, musical Austrian man.",en,,"Homemade Men in Postwar Austrian Cinema : Nationhood, Genre and Masculinity",False,1087

So why was this change so radical? In what ways did life change for people moving into these swanky new homes, and why has the legacy of the 1950s home endured for so long?

Poetry By Individual Poets,"Edwin Morgan is one of Scotland's most distinguished poets. Born in Glasgow in 1920, he served in the Second World War as a medical orderly and lectured in English Literature at Glasgow University until his retirement as a Professor in 1980. Since then his reputation as a poet has grown both within Scotland and beyond. His celebration of his native city brought him the honour of Glasgow Poet Laureate, and in 2004 the Scottish Executive recognised him officially as modern Scotland's first national poet, with the title of Scots Makar. The poetry of Edwin Morgan is so varied and original, filling a series of volumes spread over more than fifty years, that it cannot be fully reflected in a single critical compilation. This skilful commentary focuses on two contrasting sides of Morgan's work, his highly popular poetry mainly centred on the life of his home city of Glasgow and the poetry coming out of his fascination with space and science. It is a contrast that Morgan himself highlighted in the title of one of his most successful collections, From Glasgow to Saturn (1973).

Closely informed by issues relating to equality, social justice, feminism, and Judaism, her impassioned poetry was often seen as a mode of social protest, but it was also heralded for its deep emotional impact; its personal perspective; forthright discussion of the female experience, particularly sex and single parenthood at a time when these topics were largely taboo; and its wide-ranging exploration of genre and form. As Adrienne Rich wrote: ""Muriel Rukeyser's poetry is unequalled in the twentieth-century United States...She pushes us...to enlarge our sense of what poetry is about in the world, and of the place of feelings and memory in politics.""",en,,The Essential Muriel Rukeyser : Poems,False,964

History Of The Americas,"Ronald Reagan is hailed as a transformative president and an American icon, but within his twentieth-century politics lies a racial legacy that is rarely discussed. Both political parties point to Reagan as the right kind of conservative but fail to acknowledge his political attacks on people of color prior to and during his presidency. Reconsidering Reagan corrects that narrative and reveals how his views, policies, and actions were devastating for Black Americans and racial minorities and that the effects continue to resonate today.Using research from previously untapped resources including the black press, which critically covered Reagan's entire political career, Daniel S. Lucks traces Reagan's gradual embrace of conservatism, his opposition to landmark civil rights legislation, his coziness with segregationists, and his skill in tapping into white anxiety about race, riding a wave of white backlash all the way to the Presidency. He argues that Reagan has the worst civil rights record of any President since the 1920sincluding supporting South African apartheid, packing courts with conservatives, targeting laws prohibiting discrimination in education and housing, and launching the War on Drugswhich had cataclysmic consequences on the lives of Black and Brown people.Linking the past to the present, Lucks expertly examines how Reagan set the blueprint for President Trump and proves that he is not an anomaly, but in fact the logical successor to bring back the racially tumultuous America that Reagan conceptualized.",en,,"Reconsidering Reagan : Racism, Republicans, and the Road to Trump",False,1542
European History,"Germany's financial collapse in the summer of 1931 was one of the biggest economic catastrophes of modern history. It led to a global panic, brought down the international monetary system, and turned a worldwide recession into a prolonged depression. The reason for the financial collapse was Germany's large pile of foreign debt denominated in gold currency which condemned the government to cut spending, raise taxes, and lower wages in the middle of a worldwide recession. As the political resistance to this austerity policy grew, the German government began to question its debt obligations, prompting foreign investors to panic and sell their German assets. The resulting currency crisis led to the failure of the already weakened banking system and a partial sovereign default. Hitler managed to profit from the crisis, because he had been the most vocal critic of the reparation regime. As the financial system collapsed, his relentless attacks against foreign creditors and the alleged complicity of the German government resonated more than ever with the electorate. In 1931, Tobias Straumann reveals the story of the fatal crisis, demonstrating how a debt trap contributed to the rapid financial and political collapse of a European country, and to the rise of the Nazi Party.",en,,"1931 : Debt, Crisis, and the Rise of Hitler",False,1287

Contemporary Fiction,"Is this what's in store? June 12, 2030, started out like any other day in memory-and by then, memories were long. Since cancer had been cured fifteen years before, America's population was aging rapidly. That sounds like good news, but consider this: millions of baby boomers, with a big natural predator picked off, were sucking dry benefits and resources that were never meant to hold them into their eighties and beyond. Young people around the country simmered with resentment toward ""the olds"" and anger at the treadmill they could never get off of just to maintain their parents' entitlement programs. But on that June 12th, everything changed: a massive earthquake devastated Los Angeles, and the government, always teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, was unable to respond. The fallout from the earthquake sets in motion a sweeping novel of ideas that pits national hope for the future against assurances from the past and is peopled by a memorable cast of refugees and billionaires, presidents and revolutionaries, all struggling to find their way. In 2030, the author's all-too-believable imagining of where today's challenges could lead us tomorrow makes for gripping and thought-provoking listening.",en,3.47,2030 : The Real Story of What Happens to America,True,1212

"Environmental Science, Engineering & Technology","The 'Year' That Changed How We View the North This book is about a new theoretical approach that transformed the field of Arctic social studies and about a program called International Polar Year 2007-2008 (IPY) that altered the position of social research within the broader polar science. The concept for IPY was developed in 2003-2005; its vision was for researchers from many nations to work together to gain cro- disciplinary insight into planetary processes, to explore and increase our understanding of the polar regions, the Arctic and Antarctica, and of their roles in the global system. IPY 2007-2008, the fourth program of its kind, followed in the footsteps of its predecessors, the first IPY in 1882-1883, the second IPY in 1932-1933, and the third IPY (later renamed to 'International Geophysical Year' or IGY) in 1957-1958. All earlier IPY/IGY have been primarily geophysical initiatives, with their focus on meteorology, atmospheric and geomagnetic observations, and with additional emphasis on glaciology and sea ice circulation. As such, they excluded socio-economic disciplines and polar indigenous people, often deliberately, except for limited ethnographic and natural history collection work conducted by some expeditions of the first IPY. That once dominant vision biased heavily towards geophysics, oceanography, and ice-sheets, left little if any place for people, that is, the social sciences and the humanities, in what has been commonly viewed as the 'hard-core' polar research.",en,,Community Adaptation and Vulnerability in Arctic Regions,False,1506

In 13 Bankers, prominent economist Simon Johnson and James Kwak give a wide-ranging, meticulous, and bracing account of recent U.S. financial history within the context of previous showdowns between American democracy and Big Finance. They convincingly show why our future is imperiled by the ideology of finance (finance is good, unregulated finance is better, unfettered finance run amok is best) and by Wall Street's political control of government policy pertaining to it. The choice that America faces is stark: whether Washington will accede to the vested interests of an unbridled financial sector that runs up profits in good years and dumps its losses on taxpayers in lean years, or reform through stringent regulation the banking system as first and foremost an engine of economic growth. To restore health and balance to our economy, Johnson and Kwak make a radical yet feasible and focused proposal: reconfigure the megabanks to be ""small enough to fail.""",en,3.87,13 Bankers : The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown,True,1693

History Of The Americas,"Foreword by Randy E. BarnettIn 2012, the United States Supreme Court became the centre of the political world. In a dramatic and unexpected 5-4 decision, Chief Justice John Roberts voted on narrow grounds to save the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.  Unprecedented  tells the inside story of how the challenge to Obamacare raced across all three branches of government, and narrowly avoided a constitutional collision between the Supreme Court and President Obama. On November 13, 2009, a group of Federalist Society lawyers met in the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., to devise a legal challenge to the constitutionality of President Obama's  legacy"",his healthcare reform. It seemed a very long shot, and was dismissed peremptorily by the White House, much of Congress, most legal scholars, and all of the media. Two years later the fight to overturn the Affordable Care Act became a political and legal firestorm. When, finally, the Supreme Court announced its ruling, the judgment was so surprising that two cable news channels misreported it and announced that the Act had been declared unconstitutional. Unprecedented  offers unrivaled inside access to how key decisions were made in Washington, based on interviews with over one hundred of the people who lived this journey,including the academics who began the challenge, the attorneys who litigated the case at all levels, and Obama administration attorneys who successfully defended the law. It reads like a political thriller, provides the definitive account of how the Supreme Court almost struck down President Obama's  unprecedented"" law, and explains what this decision means for the future of the Constitution, the limits on federal power, and the Supreme Court.",en,4.37,Unprecedented : The Constitutional Challenge to Obamacare,True,1749

Focusing on the central figures of his life -- his four wives, his books, and his muse, Dementia -- the book leads us to suspect that the fictions Vadim has created as an author have crossed the line between his life's work and his life itself, as the worlds of reality and literary invention grow increasingly indistinguishable.

History Of The Americas,"Encounters with wild animals are among the most significant relationships between humans and the natural world. Presenting a history of human interactions with wildlife in Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan between 1870 and 1960, Wildlife, Land, and People examines the confrontations that led to diverse consequences - from the near annihilation of some species to the extraordinary preservation of others - and skilfully finds the roots of these relationships in people's needs for food, sport, security, economic development, personal fulfillment, and identity.  Donald Wetherell shows how utilitarian practices, in which humans viewed animals either as friendly sources of profit or as threats to their economic and personal security, dominated until the 1960s. Alongside these views, however, other attitudes asserted that wild animals were part of the beauty, mystery, and order of the natural world. Wetherell outlines the ways in which this attitude gained strength after World War II, distinguished by a growing conviction that every species has ecological value.",en,3.75,"Wildlife, Land, and People: Volume 238 : A Century of Change in Prairie Canada",True,1073

"Astronomy, Space & Time","This fascinating narrative recounts the history of astronomy and, with more than 100 full-color illustrations, it shows readers how to find the planets and constellations in the night sky. In ancient times, people thought that the Sun, Moon, and stars were gods. They recorded their movements and imagined that the stars made pictures in the sky. The Greeks and the Romans related these ""pictures"" of animals and men&#151;or constellations&#151;to their legends. They also identified planets and named them for their gods&#151;Venus, Mars, Saturn, and Jupiter. Their observations marked the first step in the development of astronomy, which today is a sophisticated science.  Modern astronomers have followed the tradition of naming heavenly bodies after ancient gods. For instance, the solar system's outer planets weren't identified until after the telescope's invention, but with their discoveries they were named after Uranus, a Greek god of the sky . . . Neptune, the Roman god of the sea . . . and Pluto, the Roman god of the underworld. The author recounts the legends connected with many constellations, including Aquarius, Aries, Cancer, Orion, and others.

Poetry By Individual Poets,"Presented as seventy-three narrative-style poems, some of which are rhyming and others are in prose or blank verse, Reflections on Mountaineering, A Revised and Expanded EDITION: A Journey Through Life as Experienced in the Mountains summarizes much of what the author, Alan V. Goldman, learned in his more than thirty years of climbing. Many of the same moral issues that confront us in everyday life are present in the high mountains, only to a sharper degree. Musing on topics such as awe and wonder, fear and how to confront it, the lure of the big mountains, as well as the role of luck, fate and chance, Mr. Goldman makes accessible to the general public the otherwise ""hidden"" truths that mountaineers often experience. Further, many of the poems address the human perception of reality in the context of the meaning of life itself, and of how climbers impart meaning to the mountains by the very act of climbing them. Of course, the poems deal with the feelings evoked by striving for success in the mountains, but also cope with the trauma of defeat. Above all, there is meaning to be found in the very preparation and discipline required for mountaineering, as well as in experiencing the elation of conquest, of both the mountains and of ourselves.",en,,Reflections on Mountaineering : A Revised and Expanded EDITION: A Journey Through Life as Experienced in the Mountains,False,1259

Despite their inability to make each other happy, Franklin Roosevelt transformed Eleanor from a settlement house volunteer on New York's Lower East Side into a matching partner in New York's most important power couple in a generation.When Eleanor discovered Franklin's betrayal with her younger, prettier social secretary, Lucy Mercer, she offered a divorce and vowed to face herself honestly. Here is an Eleanor both more vulnerable and more aggressive, more psychologically aware and sexually adaptable than we knew. She came to accept FDR's bond with his executive assistant, Missy LeHand; she allowed her children to live their own lives, as she never could; and she explored her sexual attraction to women, among them a star female reporter on FDR's first presidential campaign, and younger men.Eleanor needed emotional connection. She pursued deeper relationships wherever she could find them. Throughout her life and travels, there was always another person or place she wanted to heal. As FDR struggled to recover from polio, Eleanor became a voice for the voiceless, her husband's proxy in presidential ambition, and then the people's proxy in the White House. Later, she would be the architect of international human rights and world citizen of the Atomic Age, urging Americans to cope with the anxiety of global annihilation by cultivating a ""world mind."" She insisted that we cannot live for ourselves alone but must learn to live together or we will die together.Drawing on new research, Michaelis's riveting portrait is not just a comprehensive biography of a major American figure, but the story of an American ideal: how our freedom is always a choice. Eleanor rediscovers a model of what is noble and evergreen in the American character, a model we need today more than ever.",en,,Eleanor : A Life,False,2472

History Of The Americas,"The year 2020 will mark the 100th anniversary of the Nineteenth Amendment giving many women in the United States the right to vote. The struggle for suffrage lasted over six decades and involved more than a million women; yet, even at the moment of the amendment's enactment, women's activists disagreed heartily over how much had been achieved, whether it was necessary for women to continue organizing for political rights, and what those political rights would bring. Looking forward to the 100-year anniversary of the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, this collection of original essays takes a long view of the past century of women's political engagement to gauge how much women have achieved in the political arena. The volume looks back at the decades since women won the right to vote to analyze the changes, developments, and even continuities in women's roles in the broad political sphere. Ultimately, the book asks two important questions about the last 100 years of women's suffrage: 1) How did the Nineteenth Amendment alter the American political system? and 2) How has women's engagement in politics changed over the last 100 years?",en,,100 Years of the Nineteenth Amendment : An Appraisal of Women's Political Activism,False,1152

This audiobook offers fresh interpretations of the decisive moments of 1995, including the emergence of the Internet and the World Wide Web in mainstream American life; the bombing at Oklahoma City, the deadliest attack of domestic terrorism in U.S. history; the sensational ""Trial of the Century,"" at which O.J. Simpson faced charges of double murder; the U.S.-brokered negotiations at Dayton, Ohio, which ended the Bosnian War, Europe's most vicious conflict since the Nazi era; and the first encounters at the White House between Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, a liaison that culminated in a stunning scandal and the spectacle of the president's impeachment and trial.

Knowing the strength and resilience of the young American nation, Little Crow counseled caution, but anger won the day. Forced to either lead his warriors in a war he knew they could not win or leave them to their fates, he declared, ""[Little Crow] is not a coward: he will die with you."" So began six weeks of intense conflict along the Minnesota frontier as the Dakotas clashed with settlers and federal troops. Once the uprising was smashed and the Dakotas captured, a military commission was convened, which quickly found more than three hundred Indians guilty of murder.

Like the revolutionary years 1789, 1848, 1871, 1917, and 1989, it is recalled most of all as a year when revolution beckoned or threatened.

It was the year of the Tet Offensive, the Resistance, the Ultra-Resistance, the New Politics, Chavez and RFK breaking bread, LBJ's withdrawal, student revolt, barricades in Paris, the Prague Spring, SDS' sharp turn leftward, communes, the American Indian Movement, the Beatles' ""Revolution,"" the Stones' ""Street Fighting Man,"" The Population Bomb, protest at the Miss America pageant, and Black Power at the Mexico City Olympics.

History Of The Americas,"In the autumn of 1777, near Saratoga, New York, an inexperienced and improvised American army led by General Horatio Gates faced off against the highly trained British and German forces led by General John Burgoyne. The British strategy in confronting the Americans in upstate New York was to separate rebellious New England from the other colonies. Despite inferior organization and training, the Americans exploited access to fresh reinforcements of men and materiel, and ultimately handed the British a stunning defeat. Assimilating the archaeological remains from the battlefield along with the many letters, journals, and memoirs of the men and women in both camps, Dean Snow's 1777 provides a richly detailed narrative of the two battles fought at Saratoga over the course of thirty-three tense and bloody days. While the contrasting personalities of Gates and Burgoyne are well known, they are but two of the many actors who make up the larger drama of Saratoga.

History Of The Americas,"An esteemed journalist delivers a compelling on-the-ground account of the construction of President Trump's border wall in San Diego--and the impact on the lives of local residents.In August of 2019, Donald Trump finished building his border wall--at least a portion of it. In San Diego, the Army Corps of engineers completed two years of construction on a 14-mile steel beamed barrier that extends eighteen-feet high and cost a staggering $147 million. As one border patrol agent told reporters visiting the site, ""It was funded and approved and it was built under his administration. It is Trump's wall."" 14 Miles is a definitive account of all the dramatic construction, showing readers what it feels like to stand on both sides of the border looking up at the imposing and controversial barrier. After the Department of Homeland Security announced an open call for wall prototypes in 2017, DW Gibson, an award-winning journalist and Southern California native, began visiting the construction site and watching as the prototype samples were erected. Gibson spent those two years closely observing the work and interviewing local residents to understand how it was impacting them. These include April McKee, a border patrol agent leading a recruiting program that trains teenagers to work as agents; Jeff Schwilk, a retired Marine who organizes pro-wall rallies as head of the group San Diegans for Secure Borders; Roque De La Fuente, an eccentric millionaire developer who uses the construction as a promotional opportunity; and Civile Ephedouard, a Haitian refugee who spent two years migrating through Central America to the United States and anxiously awaits the results of his asylum case.

History Of The Americas,"The transformation of British America, a cluster of colonies along the Atlantic, into American America, a nation-state, was not the sudden event of legend. The process extended well beyond the American Revolution-even beyond the War of 1812 the ""Second American Revolution."" Indeed, the making of the American nation was only realized well into the nineteenth century. In telling this story, Thomas Bender's British America, American America offers a brisk, novel, and highly readable account of social, political, and cultural developments from the years of settlement to the emergence of a continental nation. A pioneer in the growing field of transnational history, he integrates the most recent scholarship into the American story and stresses the interconnections, commonalities, and differences among British and French colonies in the Americas. Bender stresses that the nineteenth-century nation-state was defined by two elements: a political system based on popular sovereignty, and a distinctive national culture. The United States was a forerunner of popular sovereignty, but it took longer to establish a recognized culture. With the paintings of the Hudson River School and the emergence of a distinctive literary language in the masterpieces of Herman Melville and Walt Whitman this goal was realized.",en,,"British America, American America : The Settling and Making of the United States",False,1314

For many others, however, disunion was seen as the main instrument by which they could achieve their partisan and sectional goals.

Often ignored and underappreciated, Brazil, according to renowned, award-winning journalist Michael Reid, has finally begun to live up to its potential but faces important challenges before it becomes a nation of substantial global significance.

In the weeks that followed, as more camps were discovered, thousands of soldiers came face to face with the monstrous reality of Hitler's Germany.These men discovered the very depths of human-imposed cruelty and depravity: railroad cars stacked with emaciated, lifeless bodies; ovens full of incinerated human remains; warehouses filled with stolen shoes, clothes, luggage, and even eyeglasses; prison yards littered with implements of torture and dead bodies; and-perhaps most disturbing of all-the half-dead survivors of the camps. For the American soldiers of all ranks who witnessed such powerful evidence of Nazi crimes, the experience was life altering. Almost all were haunted for the rest of their lives by what they had seen, horrified that humans from ostensibly civilized societies were capable of such crimes.Military historian John C. McManus sheds new light on this often-overlooked aspect of the Holocaust. Drawing on a rich blend of archival sources and thousands of firsthand accounts-including unit journals, interviews, oral histories, memoirs, diaries, letters, and published recollections-Hell before Their Very Eyes focuses on the experiences of the soldiers who liberated Ohrdruf, Buchenwald, and Dachau and their determination to bear witness to this horrific history.",en,4.23,"Hell Before Their Very Eyes : American Soldiers Liberate Concentration Camps in Germany, April 1945",True,1483

History Of The Americas,"Based on the latest scientific findings, this breakthrough book argues that most of what we thought we knew about the Americas before Columbus was wrong. In the last twenty years, archaeologists and anthropologists equipped with new scientific techniques have made far-reaching discoveries about the Americas. For example, Indians did not cross the Bering Strait 12,000 years ago, as most of us learned in school. They were already here. Their numbers were vast, not few. And instead of living lightly on the land, they managed it beautifully and left behind an enormous ecological legacy. In this riveting, accessible work of science, Charles Mann takes us on an enthralling journey of scientific exploration. We learn that the Indian development of modern corn was one of the most complex feats of genetic engineering ever performed. That the Great Plains are a third smaller today than they were in 1700 because the Indians who maintained them by burning died. And that the Amazon rain forest may be largely a human artifact. Compelling and eye-opening, this book has the potential to vastly alter our understanding of our history and change the course of today's environmental disputes.",en,4.02,1491 : New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus,True,1190

European History,"Bestselling historian Andrew Nagorski takes a fresh look at the decisive year 1941, when Hitler's miscalculations and policy of terror propelled Churchill, FDR, and Stalin into a powerful new alliance that defeated Nazi Germany. In early 1941, Hitler's armies ruled most of Europe. Churchill's Britain was an isolated holdout against the Nazi tide, but German bombers were attacking its cities and German U-boats were attacking its ships. Stalin was observing the terms of the Nazi-Soviet Pact, and Roosevelt was vowing to keep the United States out of the war. Hitler was confident that his aim of total victory was within reach. By the end of 1941, all that changed. Hitler had repeatedly gambled on escalation and lost: by invading the Soviet Union and committing a series of disastrous military blunders; by making mass murder and terror his weapons of choice, and by rushing to declare war on the United States after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. Britain emerged with two powerful new allies--Russia and the United States. By then, Germany was doomed to defeat. Nagorski illuminates the actions of the major characters of this pivotal year as never before. The Year Germany Lost the War is a stunning examination of unbridled megalomania versus determined leadership. It also reveals how 1941 set the Holocaust in motion, and presaged the postwar division of Europe, triggering the Cold War. 1941 was a year that forever defined our world.",en,4.04,1941: The Year Germany Lost the War,True,1446

History Of The Americas,"The first book to explore the historical role and residual impact of the Green Book, a travel guide for black motorists Published from 1936 to 1966, the Green Book was hailed as the ""black travel guide to America."" At that time, it was very dangerous and difficult for African-Americans to travel because black travelers couldn't eat, sleep, or buy gas at most white-owned businesses. The Green Book listed hotels, restaurants, gas stations, and other businesses that were safe for black travelers. It was a resourceful and innovative solution to a horrific problem. It took courage to be listed in the Green Book, and Overground Railroad celebrates the stories of those who put their names in the book and stood up against segregation.

History Of The Americas,"On July 4, 1852, Frederick Douglass stood in front of a crowd in Rochester, New York, and asked, ""What to the slave is the Fourth of July?"" The audience had invited him to speak on the day celebrating freedom, and had expected him to offer a hopeful message about America; instead, he'd offered back to them their own hypocrisy. How could the Constitution defend both freedom and slavery? How could it celebrate liberty with one hand while withdrawing it with another? Theirs was a country which promoted and even celebrated inequality. From the very beginning, American history can be seen as a battle to reconcile the large gap between America's stated ideals and the reality of its republic. Its struggle is not one of steady progress toward greater freedom and equality, but rather for every step forward there is a step taken in a different direction. In Inventing Equality, Michael Bellesiles traces the evolution of the battle for true equality-the stories of those fighting forward, to expand the working definition of what it means to be an American citizen-from the Revolution through the late nineteenth century. He identifies the systemic flaws in the Constitution, and explores through the role of the Supreme Court and three Constitutional amendments-the 13th, 14th, and 15th-the ways in which equality and inequality waxed and waned over the decades.",en,,Inventing Equality : Inventing Equality,False,1365

History Of The Americas,"At the beginning of 1864, the Civil War was far from won; terrible and bloody Union setbacks and casualties lay ahead. Abraham Lincoln was facing a re-election battle as some northern Democrats were ready to start peace talks that could leave the Confederacy a separate slaveholding American nation and as his secretary of the treasury, Salmon P. Chase, challenged him for the Republican nomination. But by the end of the year, the war's end was in sight, and slavery was on the verge of extinction. Despite all the turmoil of war and political infighting, Lincoln also set the stage for a new era of westward expansion. He shaped the decades to come through laws and subsidies that propelled railroads westward, by the Homestead Act that offered western lands to immigrant farmers and by the Act to Encourage Immigration that enabled 615,000 men, women, and children to arrive in America during the Civil War.

Nothing was entirely predictable or inevitable. The West hoped that Hitler would see sense if they stood firm. Hitler was convinced the West would back down. Moments of uncertainty alternated with those of confrontation; secret intelligence was used by both sides to support their hopes. The one constant feature was the determination of Poland, a country created only in 1919, to protect its newfound independence against a vastly superior enemy. 1939 documents a defining moment in the violent history of the twentieth century.",en,3.59,1939 : Countdown to War,True,1026

European History,"Strafvollzugslager der SS- und Polizei: Himmler's Wartime Institutions for the Detention of Waffen-SS and Polizei Criminals is a book that Heinrich Himmler would not have wished written. Preferring that this corner of the SS history remained forever in the shadows, the existence of the SS penal system had the potential to besmirch his entire organisation. In an effort to disguise the true extent of criminality within the ranks of the Waffen-SS, the Reichsfuhrer-SS temporarily expelled those SS men incarcerated in the Strafvollzugslager der SS- und Polizei, giving the appearance that Hitler's bodyguard did not suffer the scourge of serious criminality. In unprecedented detail, this study illuminates the reasoning behind the imprisonment of Waffen-SS and policemen in purpose-built institutions, describes the regulations governing their detention and reveals the operational history of these fascinating institutions. The Waffen-SS gaols established at Dachau, Danzig-Matzkau, Forrenbach and a clutch of smaller branch prisons are the focus of this in-depth study.",en,,Strafvollzugslager der SS und Polizei : Himmler'S Wartime Institutions for the Detention of Waffen-Ss and Polize,False,1073
History Of The Americas,"David Reynolds' major BBC Radio 4 series explores the origins of contemporary USA from its beginnings to the present day. This epic narrative tells America's story through the voices of those who lived it - presidents and farmers, mothers and children, settlers and soldiers, slaves and Indians. The series celebrates the country's achievements but also examines its paradoxes by investigating three abiding themes of American life: empire, liberty and faith. Empire of Liberty: From the arrival of Native Americans from Asia, to the slave trade and the forced relocation of the Indians, the first series describes how the US expanded to cover a whole continent, laying the foundations of a superpower - if the country could remain united. Power & Progress: The second series depicts the tragedy and heroism of the Civil War (1861-65), which finally ended slavery - though not racial discrimination - and the dynamism of the reunited nation as it grew into an industrial giant. America's role in the Second World War is also examined.",en,4.18,America: Empire of Liberty : The Complete BBC Radio 4 Series,True,1034

History Of The Americas,"A manifesto about America's unchallenged war machine, from an Afghanistan veteran and new kind of military hero. Before engaging in war, Erik Edstrom asks us to imagine three, rarely imagined scenarios: First, imagine your own death. Second, imagine war from ""the other side."" Third: Imagine what might have been if the war had never been fought. Pursuing these realities through his own combat experience, Erik reaches the unavoidable conclusion about America at war. But that realization came too late-the damage had been done. Erik Edstrom grew up in suburban Massachusetts with an idealistic desire to make an impact, ultimately leading him to the gates of West Point. Five years later, he was deployed to Afghanistan as an infantry lieutenant. Throughout his military career, he confronted atrocities, buried his friends, wrestled with depression, and struggled with an understanding that the war he fought in, and the youth he traded to prepare for it, was in contribution to a bitter truth: The War on Terror is not just a tragedy, but a crime. The deeper tragedy is that our country lacks the courage and conviction to say so. Un-American is a hybrid of social commentary and memoir that exposes how blind support for war exacerbates the problems it's intended to resolve, devastates the people allegedly being helped, and diverts assets from far larger threats like climate change.

Indeed, the very survival of the new nation was in doubt.The years from 1790 to 1795 may have been the turning point in Indian white relations on the North American continent. At this time the Indians of the Ohio country-tribes such as the Miamis, the Shawnees, and the Ottawas-engaged in a last-ditch effort to stop the settlers who were moving west into the """"Black Forest"""" wilderness of mid America.

This new volume completes the history of this crucial campaign, combining detailed research with a novelist's flair for the dramatic to reveal exactly how, despite missteps and misfortunes, the tide of war finally turned. By the end of February 1944, thanks to hard-fought and costly American victories in the first and second naval battles of Guadalcanal, the battle of Empress Augusta Bay, and the battle of Cape St George, the Japanese would no longer hold the materiel or skilled manpower advantage. From this point on, although the war was still a long way from being won, the American star was unquestionably on the ascendant, slowly, but surely, edging Japanese imperialism towards its sunset.",en,5.0,"Blazing Star, Setting Sun : The Guadalcanal-Solomons Campaign November 1942-March 1943",True,1063

European History,"Before becoming one of the longest-ruling dictators of the twentieth century, Francisco Franco commanded troops in the kinds of wars that have since become all too familiar. He not only waged vicious counterinsurgency campaigns against Muslim warlords and defiant tribes in Morocco, but he also led a multinational force to victory in Europe's ""dress rehearsal"" for World War II-the Spanish Civil War. Born into a military family in 1892, Francisco Franco first made a name for himself leading attacks against rebellious Moroccan warlords and tribesmen and by 1926 was promoted to brigadier general. His role in the ruthless suppression of the 1934 revolution by coal miners in Asturias sealed his reputation for brutality, although Franco saw it as simply carrying out an order in the most efficient manner possible. In 1936, as head of Spain's formidable Army of Africa, Franco joined a military revolt against the Popular Front government of the republic. He quickly secured the support of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, touching off more than two years of bloody civil war. Within months of the wars outbreak he became generalissimo and head of state of the rebel camp, and in 1939 Britain and France recognized him as the legitimate ruler of Spain. He then outlasted fellow dictators Hitler and Stalin by decades, dying in 1975 at the helm of the same regime he had established in Spain before the Second World War.

It sets the conflict in an historical context and includes both biographies of its principal characters and much about its political consequences. This book, Musket and Tomahawk, has been adapted from Parkman's more expansive work by the Leonaur Editors, especially for those students of military history-both serious and casual-who are primarily concerned with the war itself. This was a war fought under blazing suns and driving snows. It was fought in the deep forests, on lakes and rivers and on the slopes of mountains. It was a war of ambuscade, sieges, massacres and the storming of palisades and burning blockhouses. It brought collisions in full battle between the regular troops of Britain and France, but it also embraced militias drawn from the settlers of both sides including famous backwoodsmen and scouts who became the Rangers. Not least of those embroiled were the deadly indigenous people of the land-the Indian tribes of the Eastern Woodlands-who fought according to their individual loyalties to each side and who brought a colour and savagery which was unique to this frontier conflict.

European History,"When we consider prisoner of war camps in the First World War we inevitably think of those on the Continent. We seem to have forgotten that in the UK there were huge numbers of enemy combatants and alien civilians interned in camps right across the realm. By the end of the war there were almost 500 internment camps in England and Wales, with another twenty-five in Scotland, two on the Isle of Man and one each in Ireland and Jersey. Between them they held around 250,000 individuals. It is a dark side of history and, for reasons that have never been fully resolved, many of the locations used to intern civilians and combatants during the First World War have been lost in time - until now. In this proposed title, the author has, for the first time ever, tracked down the sites and history of each of these camps and all the places used for internment purposes in the UK during the First World have been brought together in one document.

History Of The Americas,"We are at a critical juncture in world politics. Nuclear strategy and policy have risen to the top of the global policy agenda, and issues ranging from a nuclear Iran to the global zero movement are generating sharp debate. The historical origins of our contemporary nuclear world are deeply consequential for contemporary policy, but it is crucial that decisions are made on the basis of fact rather than myth and misapprehension. In Nuclear Statecraft, Francis J. Gavin challenges key elements of the widely accepted narrative about the history of the atomic age and the consequences of the nuclear revolution.On the basis of recently declassified documents, Gavin reassesses the strategy of flexible response, the influence of nuclear weapons during the Berlin Crisis, the origins of and motivations for U.S. nuclear nonproliferation policy, and how to assess the nuclear dangers we face today. In case after case, he finds that we know far less than we think we do about our nuclear history. Archival evidence makes it clear that decision makers were more concerned about underlying geopolitical questions than about the strategic dynamic between two nuclear superpowers.Gavin's rigorous historical work not only tells us what happened in the past but also offers a powerful tool to explain how nuclear weapons influence international relations. Nuclear Statecraft provides a solid foundation for future policymaking.",en,3.81,Nuclear Statecraft : History and Strategy in America's Atomic Age,True,1421

After transformation into a division, ""Langemarck"" participated in the final fighting on the Pomeranian and Oder fronts, continuing to fight under extreme conditions, and always holding their assigned positions, counterattacking whenever possible. Most of the Flemish volunteers were able to surrender to the Anglo-American forces, thus escaping capture by the Russians. This complete treatment fills a large gap in Waffen-SS history.

European History,"During August and September 1915 almost 3000 young volunteer Irish soldiers died on the killing-fields of Gallipoli on the Turkish Adriatic. They had sailed from Dublin earlier that year as a division of Kitchener's Army. At Suvla Bay they fell to gunshot-wounds and shellfire, while thirst, sunstroke and dysentery reduced their chances of survival. Hundreds were to be burned alive in raging bush-fires. The Irishmen in this conflict of 'unparalleled brutality, ferocity and waste' were of all creeds and classes. Former 'Larkinites' from Dublin's docks fought alongside Trinity students, stockbrokers and barristers. Unionists from Portadown and Ballymena marched with nationalists from Castlebar and Skibbereen. Some enlisted out of a sense of patriotic duty, others simply in order to 'get regular meals'. Whole groups of friends such as 'The Dublin Pals' and 'The Toffs in the Toughs' enlisted - and died - together. In post-war Ireland political revolution led to the removal of Gallipoli from memory. One popular ballad told the Volunteers 'you fought for the wrong country, you died for the wrong cause, when the greater war was at home'. The bone-strewn strands of Suvla were forgotten.Almost ninety years later, the author came across a quiet country road in the Irish midlands called 'The Dardanelles', which sent him on a journey of discovery, and recovery.",en,4.66,Field of Bones : The Gallipoli Campaign,True,1370

In 1943, the Rangers were sent to Britain, where they were converted to a heavy weapons support unit, armed with machine guns and mortars in preparation for the invasion of Normandy.In this illuminating account, Matthew Douglass uncovers their participation in the war: their arrival in Normandy and their contributions to the battles in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany. Present at many of the critical moments of the campaign, the Rangers participated in the Battle of the Falaise Gap, which cleared the way for the advance on Paris and the German border; the Battle of the Scheldt, which secured the vital supply lines of the port of Antwerp; and the Battle of the Reichswald, when German resistance on the west bank of the Rhine was finally broken.

The U.S. Army stood at fewer than 200,000 men-unprepared to defend the country, much less carry the fight to Europe and the Far East. And yet, less than a year after Pearl Harbor, the American army led the Allied invasion of North Africa, beginning the campaign that would defeat Germany, and the Navy and Marines were fully engaged with Japan in the Pacific.The story of America's astounding industrial mobilization during World War II has been told. But what has never been chronicled before Paul Dickson's The Rise of the G. I. Army, 1940-1941 is the extraordinary transformation of America's military from a disparate collection of camps with dilapidated equipment into a well-trained and spirited army ten times its prior size in little more than eighteen months. From Franklin Roosevelt's selection of George C. Marshall to be Army Chief of Staff to the remarkable peace-time draft of 1940 and the massive and unprecedented mock battles in Tennessee, Louisiana, and the Carolinas by which the skill and spirit of the Army were forged and out of which iconic leaders like Eisenhower, Bradley, and Clark emerged; Dickson narrates America's urgent mobilization against a backdrop of political and cultural isolationist resistance and racial tension at home, and the increasingly perceived threat of attack from both Germany and Japan.An important addition to American history, The Rise of the G.

European History,"Ruler of Florence for seven bloody years, 1531 to 1537, Alessandro de' Medici was arguably the first person of color to serve as a head of state in the Western world. Born out of wedlock to a dark-skinned maid and Lorenzo de' Medici, he was the last legitimate heir to the line of Lorenzo the Magnificent. When Alessandro's noble father died of syphilis, the family looked to him. Groomed for power, he carved a path through the backstabbing world of Italian politics in a time when cardinals, popes, and princes vied for wealth and advantage. By the age of nineteen, he was prince of Florence, inheritor of the legacy of the grandest dynasty of the Italian Renaissance. Alessandro faced down family rivalry and enormous resistance from Florence's oligarchs, who called him a womanizer-which he undoubtedly was--and a tyrant. Yet this real-life counterpart to Machiavelli's Prince kept his grip on power until he was assassinated at the age of 26 during a late-night tryst arranged by his scheming cousins. After his death, his brief but colorful reign was criticized by those who had murdered him in a failed attempt to restore the Florentine republic. For the first time, the true story is told in The Black Prince of Florence. Catherine Fletcher tells the riveting tale of Alessandro's unexpected rise and spectacular fall, unraveling centuries-old mysteries, exposing forgeries, and bringing to life the epic personalities of the Medicis, Borgias, and others as they waged sordid campaigns to rise to the top. Drawing on new research and first-hand sources, this biography of a most intriguing Renaissance figure combines archival scholarship with discussions of race and class that are still relevant today.",en,3.8,The Black Prince of Florence : The Spectacular Life and Treacherous World of Alessandro De' Medici,True,1712

However, nothing could excuse the slaughter of guilty and innocent officers alike as the mutineers went wild and committed crimes beyond anything Pigot could have dreamt up. Not content with that, they then took the ship into an enemy port and gave her up to the Spanish who, unaware of the true facts for some time, nevertheless greeted them with the contempt they deserved. The Spanish took the ship into their service but due to an amazing episode of red tape and internal wrangling, never actually got the frigate to sea.

European History,"In 1795 - the year Napoleon Bonaparte was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the French army in Italy - the seventeen-year-old Jean-Nicolas-Auguste Noel entered the Artillery School at Chalons. A year later, with Napoleon proclaiming himself the liberator of Italy, Noel was appointed second lieutenant in the 8th Regiment of Horse Artillery. Written in 1850, With Napoleon's Guns is his remarkable memoir of two decades in the Emperor's service.  A trained artilleryman himself, Napoleon dramatically transformed the role of artillery from a cumbersome and tactically limited force into a fluid, independent and highly mobile trans d'artillerie. This new organisation required fresh, new officers who could act on their own initiative - officers such as Noel.  From the optimism of the early years in Italy , through the privations of the retreat from Moscow and the horrors of the Battle of Leipzig to the disillusionment of the Emperor's defeat at Waterloo, Noel charts both his personal career and, at close hand, the rise and fall of the First Empire with frankness and percipience.Based on his journal he kept from his cadetship at Chalons, With Napoleon's Guns is a revealing account of an officer at the heart of Napoleon's army.",en,,With Napoleon's Guns,False,1234

Seizing the opportunity to bypass Caen's defences, a mixed mobile force of tanks, infantry and artillery, formed around the 7th Armoured Division's 22nd Armoured Brigade, advanced through the gap towards Villers-Bocage.",en,3.0,7th Armoured Division at Villers-Bocage : 13th July 1944,True,553

History Of The Americas,"America's beloved and distinguished historian presents, in a book of breathtaking excitement, drama, and narrative force, the stirring story of the year of our nation's birth, 1776, interweaving, on both sides of the Atlantic, the actions and decisions that led Great Britain to undertake a war against her rebellious colonial subjects and that placed America's survival in the hands of George Washington. In this masterful book, David McCullough tells the intensely human story of those who marched with General George Washington in the year of the Declaration of Independence--when the whole American cause was riding on their success, without which all hope for independence would have been dashed and the noble ideals of the Declaration would have amounted to little more than words on paper.  Based on extensive research in both American and British archives, 1776 is a powerful drama written with extraordinary narrative vitality. It is the story of Americans in the ranks, men of every shape, size, and color, farmers, schoolteachers, shoemakers, no-accounts, and mere boys turned soldiers. And it is the story of the King's men, the British commander, William Howe, and his highly disciplined redcoats who looked on their rebel foes with contempt and fought with a valor too little known.  Written as a companion work to his celebrated biography of John Adams, David McCullough's 1776 is another landmark in the literature of American history.",en,4.07,1776,True,1451
History Of The Americas,"Up until very recently it was believed that in 1491, the year before Columbus landed, the Americas, one-third of the earth's surface, were a near-pristine wilderness inhabited by small roaming bands of indigenous people. But recently unexpected discoveries have dramatically changed our understanding of Indian life. Many scholars now argue that the Indians were much more numerous, were in the Americas for far longer and had far more ecological impact on the land than previously believed. This knowledge has enormous implications for today's environmental disputes, yet little has filtered into textbooks and even less into public awareness. Mann brings together all of the latest research, and the results of his own travels throughout North and South America, to provide a new, fascinating and iconoclastic account of the Americas before Columbus.",en,4.02,1491 : The Americas Before Columbus,True,852

This is one of the questions that Kiril Tomoff seeks to answer in Creative Union, the first book about any of the professional unions that dominated Soviet cultural life at the time. Drawing on hitherto untapped archives, he shows how the Union of Soviet Composers established control over the music profession and negotiated the relationship between composers and the Communist Party leadership. Central to Tomoff's argument is the institutional authority and prestige that the musical profession accrued and deployed within Soviet society, enabling musicians to withstand the postwar disciplinary campaigns that were so crippling in other artistic and literary spheres.",en,3.4,"Creative Union : The Professional Organization of Soviet Composers, 1939-1953",True,905

Far from unusual, this voyage was one of many that unfolded across an open Caribbean seascape in which Guantanamo served as a waypoint in a larger odyssey of oceanic migration.

Not just any plumbers, but the ""Nixon plumbers,"" hired by the White House to ""stop leaks"" by any means necessary. Officially, they were the Special Investigation Unit. Unofficially, they were the ""dirty tricks squad,"" whose illegal actions eventually caused the President to resign his office. Bill Merrill prosecuted the plumbers. Here, more than thirty years later, he reveals how he did it. On September 4, 1971, two burglars later identified as E. Howard Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy broke into the office of Lewis Fielding, a Beverly Hills psychiatrist, among whose patients was Daniel Ellsberg, a prominent antiwar activist who had recently released to the press the formerly top-secret ""Pentagon Papers."" On June 13, 1972, five burglars entered the offices of the Democratic National Committee, which were located in the Watergate complex in Washington, DC. Both of these crimes were eventually traced back to the ""plumbers unit,"" which was directed by John Ehrlichman, President Nixon's top domestic aide. As he convincingly recounts, Merrill sought the job as Assistant Special Prosecutor for one reason: to bring these criminals to justice. In addition, as this revelatory account makes clear, he pursued that goal tenaciously. Merrill wrote this book in 1978, but never published it. Today, at the age of 83, he is confined to a VA hospital in Michigan, the victim of a debilitating stroke. In 1974, Merrill was mentioned in the media almost every day during the Watergate trials. Directing a team of attorneys and assistants, he constructed cases against all of the plumbers and he won every case. ""Watergate"" continues to reverberate in the American consciousness today. Revelations that the White House had planned and carried out illegal acts fundamentally rocked the nation. In his response to these unprecedented crimes, William Merrill literally changed the course of history. This is his story.""",en,,Watergate Prosecutor,False,2109

History Of The Americas,"This book thematically analyses and surveys areas of Caribbean history and society. The work is divided into three parts: part one addresses migration and identity; part two explores policy and development; and part three explores music and literature. The volume places a fresh perspective on these topics. The essays depart from the usual broader themes of politics, economics and society and provide a deeper insight into forces that left a decisive legacy on aspects of the Caribbean region. Such contributions come at a time when some of the Caribbean territories are marking over 50 years as independent nation states and attempting to create, understand and forge ways of dealing with critical national and regional issues. The volume brings together a broad group of scholars writing on Caribbean issues including postgraduate students, lecturers, and researchers. Each chapter is thematically divided into the aforementioned areas. This book addresses areas much deeper than the linear historical and social science models, and it offers Caribbean academics and researchers a foundation for further research.",en,,Regional Discourses on Society and History : Shaping the Caribbean,False,1117

Die Rechtsatzungen (Taqqanot) der Gemeinden (Qehillot) stehen in einer besonderen judischen Rechtstradition, die aktuelle zeitgenossische Probleme des gemeindlichen Zusammenlebens oder auch des Familienrechts aufgreift und diese einer Losung zufuhrt. Dabei konnen Taqqanot, wie auch im Fall der rheinischen Gemeinden, sowohl durch einzelne judische Rechtsgelehrte wie auch durch das Leitungsgremium einzelner Gemeinden autorisiert werden.

History Of The Americas,"Tastemakers and Tastemaking develops a new approach to analyzing violence in Mexican films and television by examining the curation of violence in relation to three key moments: the decade-long centennial commemoration of the Mexican Revolution launched in 2010; the assaults and murders of women in Northern Mexico since the late 1990s; and the havoc wreaked by the illegal drug trade since the early 2000s. Niamh Thornton considers how violence is created, mediated, selected, or categorized by tastemakers, through the strategic choices made by institutions, filmmakers, actors, and critics. Challenging assumptions about whose and what kind of work merit attention and traversing normative boundaries between ""good"" and ""bad"" taste, Thornton draws attention to the role of tastemaking in both ""high"" and ""low"" media, including film cycles and festivals, adaptations of Mariano Azuela's 1915 novel, Los de Abajo, Amat Escalante's hyperrealist art films, and female stars of recent genre films and the telenovela, La reina del sur. Making extensive use of videographic criticism, Thornton pays particularly close attention to the gendered dimensions of violence, both on and off screen.",en,,Tastemakers and Tastemaking : Mexico and Curated Screen Violence,False,1188

History Of The Americas,"Closing Sysco presents a history of deindustrialization and working-class resistance in the Cape Breton steel industry between 1945 and 2001. The Sydney Steel Works is at the heart of this story, having existed in tandem with Cape Breton's larger coal operations since the early twentieth century. The book explores the multifaceted nature of deindustrialization; the internal politics of the steelworkers' union; the successful efforts to nationalize the mill in 1967; the years in transition under public ownership; and the confrontations over health, safety, and environmental degradation in the 1990s and 2000s. Closing Sysco moves beyond the moment of closure to trace the cultural, historical, and political ramifications of deindustrialization that continue to play out in post-industrial Cape Breton Island. A significant intervention into the international literature on deindustrialization, this study pushes scholarship beyond the bounds of political economy and cultural change to begin tackling issues of bodily health, environment, and historical memory in post-industrial places.",en,,Closing Sysco : Industrial Decline in Atlantic Canada's Steel City,False,1094
History Of The Americas,"In Men, Mobs, and Law, Rebecca N. Hill compares two seemingly unrelated types of leftist protest campaigns: those intended to defend labor organizers from prosecution and those seeking to memorialize lynching victims and stop the practice of lynching. Arguing that these forms of protest are related and have substantially influenced one another, Hill points out that both worked to build alliances through appeals to public opinion in the media, by defining the American state as a force of terror, and by creating a heroic identity for their movements. Each has played a major role in the history of radical politics in the United States. Hill illuminates that history by considering the narratives produced during the abolitionist John Brown's trials and execution, analyzing the defense of the Chicago anarchists of the Haymarket affair, and comparing Ida B. Wells's and the NAACP's anti-lynching campaigns to the Industrial Workers of the World's early-twentieth-century defense campaigns. She also considers conflicts within the campaign to defend Sacco and Vanzetti, chronicles the history of the Communist Party's International Labor Defense, and explores the Black Panther Party's defense of George Jackson.As Hill explains, labor defense activists first drew on populist logic, opposing the masses to the state in their campaigns, while anti-lynching activists went in the opposite direction, castigating ""the mob"" and appealing to the law. Showing that this difference stems from the different positions of whites and Blacks in the American legal system, Hill's comparison of anti-lynching organizing and radical labor defenses reveals the conflicts and intersections between antiracist struggle and socialism in the United States.",en,4.42,"Men, Mobs, and Law : Anti-Lynching and Labor Defense in U.S. Radical History",True,1742

Conflict and Enlightenment uses a resolutely comparative approach to re-examine what was being disseminated in print, and how. By mapping the transmission of texts across cultural and linguistic divides, Munck reveals how far new forms of political discourse varied depending on the particular perspectives of authors, readers and regulatory authorities, as well as the cultural adaptability of translators and sponsors.",en,,"Conflict and Enlightenment : Print and Political Culture in Europe, 1635-1795",False,1012

History Of The Americas,"*Includes pictures *Includes contemporary accounts of the crash and the official government report on it *Includes online resources and a bibliography for further reading *Includes a table of contents ""The many rumors regarding the flying disc became a reality yesterday when the intelligence office of the 509th Bomb group of the Eighth Air Force, Roswell Army Air Field, was fortunate enough to gain possession of a disc through the cooperation of one of the local ranchers and the sheriff's office of Chaves County. The flying object landed on a ranch near Roswell sometime last week. Not having phone facilities, the rancher stored the disc until such time as he was able to contact the sheriff's office, who in turn notified Maj. Jesse A. Marcel of the 509th Bomb Group Intelligence Office. Action was immediately taken and the disc was picked up at the rancher's home. It was inspected at the Roswell Army Air Field and subsequently loaned by Major Marcel to higher headquarters."" - A press release issued by the Roswell Army Air Field, July 8, 1947 The essence of the event commonly known as the Roswell Crash is that someone saw something in the sky during the summer of 1947. Days later someone else found some odd foil, paper and wood on the grounds of a ranch in the New Mexico desert nearly a hundred miles from Roswell. A day or two after that, the debris was taken to a military airbase in Roswell, New Mexico, where it remained overnight before the military flew it to another airbase in Ohio. The story of the Roswell Crash tends to focus on New Mexico, not on the traveling debris found on the ground. Ironically, the Roswell Crash never happened in Roswell. That's not to say there was no 1947 crash. Something did appear on the ground that appeared to have come from the sky-but it wasn't found anywhere near Roswell. Part of what was found was eventually moved to the airbase in Roswell where it remained overnight, inspiring the name the Roswell Crash. Few things in American history are as controversial as Roswell. The one undeniable fact is that something happened near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947, but beyond that, the facts become murky as memories and evidence lose their luster over the years. That said, the impact of an unidentified object continues to mystify residents, visitors and the curious, and it has not only put Roswell on the map but has kept it there for thousands of tourists. At the very least, the Roswell Crash has become a meme. Even among those who do not believe there was a crash at all, the vast majority of people recognize the reference especially after the television show The X-Files and assume that it allegedly did (or did not) crash within the city limits of Roswell. To most people, Roswell means UFOs. While much of the information disseminated has been in the form of press releases published in newspapers, the FBI eventually relented and released their records involving the Roswell crash. In 2011, more than 2,000 individual documents about this event were scanned and published as the digital project ""The Vault,"" part of nearly 7,000 items on various subjects in the Freedom of Information Act's Library. Nonetheless, skepticism about the official version of the incident prevails, and a countless number of people continue to believe the American government covered up a crash landing by aliens. As John B. Alexander, Ph. D., a former project manager at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and consultant to the CIA, put it, ""Attempting to come to any complete resolution of the incident is a fool's errand, as whatever the truth may have been has become so distorted over time that facts have merged inextricably with fiction.""

History Of The Americas,"*Includes pictures *Includes accounts of purported UFO sightings and Roswell *Includes online resources and a bibliography for further reading *Includes a table of contents ""The point is that the idea of space vehicles shaped like flying saucers was imprinted in the national psyche for many years prior to 1947, when the Roswell incident took place. It didn't take much stretching for the first observers of UFOs to assume that the unknown objects hovering in the sky had the same disk shape as the science fictional vehicles."" - Frank Wu, illustrator for science fiction magazines When people think about unidentified flying objects (UFOs), they tend to think of flying discs piloted by gray beings with large heads and enormous eyes. They tend to think that these sightings only started relatively recently and that belief in UFOs is some sort of modern religion brought on, perhaps, by the very justifiable fears of a nuclear age. But a study of the phenomenon quickly reveals that humanity has been seeing UFOs since the beginning of recorded history and perhaps a lot longer than that. Modern Ufology focuses on mysterious lights on Ceres or tales of alien abduction, but this wasn't always the case. Looking at how belief in the UFO phenomenon has changed and how it has stayed the same sheds new light on how culture and belief changes over time. You don't have to believe humans are actually being visited by aliens from another planet to recognize the importance of UFOs in human society. Any widespread belief that endures for centuries is worthy of study, and as always, cases exist that can't be explained away as simple ""belief"" ... Everyone is familiar with theories about UFOs, or ""flying saucers"" as they were often called then, but even this name dates back only to 1947. Before that time, they were called ""ghost rockets"" or ""ghost airplanes"" or ""ghost airships."" Before the age of flight, the flying objects were called various things such as ""flying chariots."" No matter what terminology is used, every generation has clearly had its own belief that mankind is not alone. For example, few things in American history are as controversial as the Roswell Crash. The one undeniable fact is that something happened near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947, but beyond that, the facts become murky as memories and evidence lose their luster over the years. That said, the impact of an unidentified object continues to mystify residents, visitors and the curious, and it has not only put Roswell on the map but has kept it there for thousands of tourists.

But if you're me--Annie Marck, alias Cleves--and you accidentally transform into teenage royalty by entering Lancaster High on the arm of the king himself? Life becomes the exact opposite of boring. Henry has it all: he's the jock, the genius and the brooding bad boy all in one. Which sort of explains why he's on his sixth girlfriend in two years. What it doesn't explain is why two of them--two of us--are dead. My best friend thinks it's Henry's fault, which is obviously ridiculous.

History Of The Americas,"With the Supreme Court likely to reverse Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion decision, American debate appears fixated on clashing rights. The first comprehensive legal history of a vital period, Abortion and the Law in America illuminates an entirely different and unexpected shift in the terms of debate. Rather than simply championing rights, those on opposing sides battled about the policy costs and benefits of abortion and laws restricting it. This mostly unknown turn deepened polarization in ways many have missed. Never abandoning their constitutional demands, pro-choice and pro-life advocates increasingly disagreed about the basic facts. Drawing on unexplored records and interviews with key participants, Ziegler complicates the view that the Supreme Court is responsible for the escalation of the conflict.

Conclusion Lime in Your Soil Author Bio Publisher Introduction A good example of green manure - Phacelia tanacetifolia For a number of us gardeners out there, experienced as well as newbies, the moment somebody tells us about nourishing the soil, our minds immediately go back straight to the packages of chemical fertilizer that we have bought so recently. And if we are organically minded, we think of the compost that has been decomposing in one corner of our garden, for the past 6 months. I wrote a book called Feeding the Hungry Soil about how you can feed the hungry side with a large amount of natural compost, leaf compost, poultry manure, and bone meal and other ways in which the soil can replenish the nourishment which it has lost during the growing of your harvest. If you are interested in knowing more about this particular essential area of helping your garden to grow naturally you can purchase this book on Amazon. This book is a continuation of how you can keep feeding the land. Naturally, you are going to be using time-tested and timeworn methods, which have been used for millenniums, and which have never poisoned the earth. Not many people know about green manuring. When I spoke about this to a horticulturalist friend, he said in a really tired sort of way - oh, you so boring botanists, whatever will you think up next? When I told him all about green manuring, he told me that he really did not have the time and the energy to promote this particular face of agriculture in his agriculture college, because really, who would like to dig deep in the ground, and put in green fertilizer? He had much better and less wearying things to do. When I told him that this was the way in which city soil in which the sand content was really high, could be made fertile again, he told me to experiment beforehand, and show him the proof, in a herb garden, so that he may think of applying this part of gardening know-how in his agricultural curriculum and practical practice. So, why am I advocating green manuring? If you are a person of Faith, just look around you. Give thanks to the bounty given to you by Mother Nature and by God. After that, you may want to look at the holy Bible. In Leviticus, God said that the land has to rest every 7 years.",en,,Knowing the Value of Green Manure - Using green manure for a richer fertile soil,False,2609

European History,"A century after the outbreak of the Great War, we have forgotten the central role that international law and the dramatically different interpretations of it played in the conflict's origins and conduct. In A Scrap of Paper, Isabel V. Hull compares wartime decision-making in Germany, Great Britain, and France, weighing the impact of legal considerations in each. Throughout, she emphasizes the profound tension between international law and military necessity in time of war, and demonstrates how differences in state structures and legal traditions shaped the way in which each of the three belligerents fought the war. Hull focuses on seven cases in which each government's response was shaped by its understanding of and respect for the law: Belgian neutrality, the land war in the west, the occupation of enemy territory, the blockade, unrestricted submarine warfare, the introduction of new weaponry (including poison gas and the zeppelin), and reprisals. Drawing on voluminous research in German, British, and French archives, the author reconstructs the debates over military decision making and clarifies the role played by law-where it constrained action, where it was manipulated to serve military need, where it was simply ignored, and how it developed in the crucible of combat. She concludes that Germany did not speak the same legal language as the two liberal democracies, with disastrous and far-reaching consequences. The first book on international law and the Great War published since 1920, A Scrap of Paper is a passionate defense of the role that the law must play to govern interstate relations in both peace and war.",en,4.2,A Scrap of Paper : Breaking and Making International Law during the Great War,True,1642

Within 20 years, the railroads would be used to transport repeat orders for the booming air rifle industry to all corners of the United States. The rail lines made industry possible for a small burg outside of the metropolitan area of Detroit. Because of the distance to other cities, passenger transportation was always an important mission of railroads. These needs were met between 1899 and 1928 by the Detroit, Plymouth & Northville Railroad (Interurban).

History Of The Americas,"Did the Maya really predict that the world would end in December of 2012? If not, how and why has 2012 millenarianism gained such popular appeal? In this deeply knowledgeable book, two leading historians of the Maya answer these questions in a succinct, readable, and accessible style. Matthew Restall and Amara Solari introduce, explain, and ultimately demystify the 2012 phenomenon. They begin by briefly examining the evidence for the prediction of the world's end in ancient Maya texts and images, analyzing precisely what Maya priests did and did not prophesize. The authors then convincingly show how 2012 millenarianism has roots far in time and place from Maya cultural traditions, but in those of medieval and Early Modern Western Europe. Revelatory any myth-busting, while remaining firmly grounded in historical fact, this fascinating book will be essential reading as the countdown to December 21, 2012, begins.",en,,2012 and the End of the World : The Western Roots of the Maya Apocalypse,False,923

Contemporary Fiction,"Experience postwar Europe through the diary of a fascinating and witty twentieth-century writer and artist. Recording his travels in France and Switzerland, Curzio Malaparte encounters famous figures such as Cocteau and Camus and captures the fraught, restless spirit of Paris after the trauma of war.  In 1947 Curzio Malaparte returned to Paris for the first time in fourteen years. In between, he had been condemned by Mussolini to five years in exile and, on release, repeatedly imprisoned. In his intervals of freedom, he had been dispatched as a journalist to the Eastern Front, and though many of his reports from the bloodlands of Poland and Ukraine were censored, his experiences there became the basis for his unclassifiable postwar masterpiece and international bestseller, Kaputt. Now, returning to the one country that had always treated him well, the one country he had always loved, he was something of a star, albeit one that shines with a dusky and disturbing light.  The journal he kept while in Paris records a range of meetings with remarkable people--Jean Cocteau and a dourly unwelcoming Albert Camus among them--and is full of Malaparte's characteristically barbed reflections on the temper of the time. It is a perfect model of ambiguous reserve as well as humorous self-exposure. There is, for example, Malaparte's curious custom of sitting out at night and barking along with the neighborhood dogs--dogs, after all, were his only friends when in exile. The French find it puzzling, to say the least; when it comes to Switzerland, it is grounds for prosecution!",en,3.0,Diary of a Foreigner in Paris,True,1585

The child of marginalized Scots-Irish immigrants, Rogers learned to survive in New England's dark and deadly forests, grasping, as did few others, that a new world required new forms of warfare. John F. Ross not only re-creates Rogers's life and his spectacular battles with breathtaking immediacy and meticulous accuracy, but brings a new and provocative perspective on Rogers's unique vision of a unified continent, one that would influence Thomas Jefferson and inspire the Lewis and Clark expedition. Rogers's principles of unconventional war-making would lay the groundwork for the colonial strategy later used in the War of Independence--and prove so compelling that army rangers still study them today.

In arresting, but harrowing, prose, James Daschuk examines the roles that Old World diseases, climate, and, most disturbingly, Canadian politics--the politics of ethnocide--played in the deaths and subjugation of thousands of Indigenous people in the realization of Sir John A. Macdonald's ""National Dream."" It was a dream that came at great expense: the present disparity in health and economic well-being between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations, and the lingering racism and misunderstanding that permeates the national consciousness to this day.  This new edition of Clearing the Plains has a foreword by Pulitzer Prize winning author, Elizabeth Fenn, an opening by Niigaanwewidam James Sinclair, and explanations of the book's influence by leading Canadian historians. Called ""one of the most important books of the twenty-first century"" by the Literary Review of Canada,  it was named a ""Book of the Year"" by The Globe and Mail, Quill & Quire, the Writers' Trust, and won the Sir John A.

"Environmental Science, Engineering & Technology","Transport of Delight is a true interdisciplinary work, and includes a thorough analytical assessment of the Los Angeles rail program, with a focus on the Long Beach Blue Line light rail-the first of the new projects to go ahead. En route, it shows that ridership forecasting for this project was not only biased and statistically invalid, but in fact done to justify decisions made on other grounds. This unusual book develops a novel theory of myth to explain the construction of rail passenger transit in Los Angeles when it had little to offer the needs of a dispersed autopolis, whose urgent but dispersed public transportation needs could have been better served by developing the regional bus system. The author conducted interviews and performed the detective work necessary to reveal an unlikely logic that held together a network of symbols, images, and metaphors that together present powerful mythical beliefs in the guise of truth. A political analysis shows how consensus was reached to proceed with the light rail to Long Beach, but political explanations are ultimately found lacking, because they cannot explain why decision-makers would want to put the rail in place. It is only when provocative metaphors-of the need to connect communities and to restore a mythical balance to a dysfunctional transportation system-and symbols-of escape from the pressure cooker of poverty, of urban success, power and, indeed sexual acumen-are surfaced, that we realize that Los Angeles' Transport of Delight is the result of the very human need to transcend complexity by providing mythical creations that appear to offer easy answers to society's deepest problems.",en,,Transport of Delight : The Mythical Conception of Rail Transit in Los Angeles,False,1668
History Of The Americas,"At the turn of the century, diverse political, economic, and social conditions divided Ecuador. During the construction of the Guayaquil-Quito Railway, the people of Ecuador faced the challenge of working together. The Redemptive Work: Railway and Nation in Ecuador, 1895-1930 examines local, regional, and national perspectives on the building of the railway and analyzes the contradictory processes of national incorporation. The elite landowners of the highlands were concerned with the transportation of their agricultural products to the coast, while the agro-export elite of the coast were more interested in forming a labor market. Because the underlying objectives were contradictory, only a partial consensus was reached on the nature of national development. The Redemptive Work is the first text to deal with these complex issues in Ecuador's history.

History Of The Americas,"A twenty-first century reckoning with the legendary Texas Rangers that does justice to their heroic moments while also documenting atrocities, brutality, oppression, and corruption The Texas Rangers came to life in 1823, when Texas was still part of Mexico. Nearly 200 years later, the Rangers are still going--one of the most famous of all law enforcement agencies. In Cult of Glory, Doug J. Swanson has written a sweeping account of the Rangers that chronicles their epic, daring escapades while showing how the white and propertied power structures of Texas used them as enforcers, protectors and officially sanctioned killers. Cult of Glory begins with the Rangers' emergence as conquerors of the wild and violent Texas frontier. They fought the fierce Comanches, chased outlaws, and served in the U.S. Army during the Mexican War. As Texas developed, the Rangers were called upon to catch rustlers, tame oil boomtowns, and patrol the perilous Texas-Mexico border. In the 1930s they began their transformation into a professionally trained police force. Countless movies, television shows, and pulp novels have celebrated the Rangers as Wild West supermen. In many cases, they deserve their plaudits. But often the truth has been obliterated. Swanson demonstrates how the Rangers and their supporters have operated a propaganda machine that turned agency disasters and misdeeds into fables of triumph, transformed murderous rampages--including the killing of scores of Mexican civilians--into valorous feats, and elevated scoundrels to sainthood. Cult of Glory sets the record straight. Beginning with the Texas Indian wars, Cult of Glory embraces the great, majestic arc of Lone Star history. It tells of border battles, range disputes, gunslingers, massacres, slavery, political intrigue, race riots, labor strife, and the dangerous lure of celebrity. And it reveals how legends of the American West--the real and the false--are truly made.",en,4.0,Cult of Glory : The Bold and Brutal History of the Texas Rangers,True,1946

European History,"In 2004, world attention was focused on Ukraine's 'Orange Revolution', which appeared to herald a new and promising era for independent Ukraine. Though such hopes proved over-optimistic there is no question that Ukraine has embarked on the process of nation building. But a new nation needs a national history and in this sphere, there has been sustained debate over the interpretations of the recent past. David R. Marples examines these narratives through a wide variety of books, scholarly and newspaper articles, and school textbooks, focusing on some of the most difficult events of the Stalin years in narratives from 1988 to 2005.His focus is on some of the most tragic events of the 20th century: the Famine of 1932-33, the consequences of the Nazi-Soviet Pact, integral nationalism and the war roles of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) and Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), and the Ukrainian-Polish conflict of 1943-47.

History Of The Americas,"orn in 1595 in Durham County, England, William Blackstone grew up in genteel circumstances, earned a bachelor's degree in 1617 and a master's in 1621 from Cambridge University, and received Holy Orders in the Church of England soon thereafter. Having disagreements with the Anglican Church, he sailed to New England with the Gorges expedition in 1623. Although the venture failed and most of the people returned to England, Blackstone opted to stay in the New World. In 1659 he married Sarah Fisher Stevenson, a widow. This major work looks at William Blackstone, the man and his life. He was the first European to settle in what is now Boston and the first to live in what is now Rhode Island.

The immigrants and their progeny prospered and distinguished themselves in various fields of science, commerce, art, and industry. They helped launch Charlie Chaplin s career, produced coumarin used in flavorings and perfumes, wrote a popular guide for 19th-century immigrants, and helped shape the nation s banking industry.

History Of The Americas,"When war broke out in Europe in 1914, political leaders in the United States were swayed by popular opinion to remain neutral; yet less than three years later, the nation declared war on Germany. In  Nothing Less Than War: A New History of America's Entry into World War I, Justus D. Doenecke examines the clash of opinions over the war during this transformative period and offers a fresh perspective on America's decision to enter World War I. Doenecke reappraises the public and private diplomacy of President Woodrow Wilson and his closest advisors and explores in great depth the response of Congress to the war. He also investigates the debates that raged in the popular media and among citizen groups that sprang up across the country as the U.S. economy was threatened by European blockades and as Americans died on ships sunk by German U-boats. The decision to engage in battle ultimately belonged to Wilson, but as Doenecke demonstrates, Wilson's choice was not made in isolation.  Nothing Less Than War provides a comprehensive examination of America's internal political climate and its changing international role during the seminal period of 1914--1917.",en,3.75,My Century in History : Memoirs,True,1167
European History,"It was the year of the glorious Battle of Britain, of the heroic evacuation of Dunkirk. It was the time when the mighty British empire declared its intention to fight the Nazis-alone if necessary-to the bitter end. It was, as Churchill dubbed it, Britain's ""Finest Hour."" In 1940: Myth and Reality, Clive Ponting reveals that it was nothing of the sort. Britain was broke in 1940 and utterly dependent on the United States for economic aid. The government fabricated German casualty figures after the Battle of Britain, suppressed knowledge of the complete fiasco that led to Dunkirk, and actually tried secretly to sue for peace that year. The British people were at best grimly resigned to the war; at worst they suffered appalling privations. Without denigrating the heroism of individuals, Mr. Ponting offers a startling account of the ineptitude and propaganda that marked much of 1940: Britain's stormy relations with France, its bizarre attempts to force a united Ireland, and the unpopularity of Winston Churchill. While he made rousing speeches in the House of Commons, Churchill rarely broadcast to the nation: his stirring ""we shall fight on the beaches"" speech was in fact broadcast by the actor who played Larry the Lamb on Children's Hour.",en,3.93,1940: Myth and Reality,True,1253

European History,"At thirty-seven, Colonel Count Claus von Stauffenberg, Chief of Staff of the Reich Reserve Army, was a charismatic figure destined for supreme command. The group of conspirators with whom he conceived the plot to kill Hitler in July 1944 was called 'Secret Germany'. That was also the name of the esoteric circle in which Stauffenberg as a young man had been a disciple of the mystic anti-Nazi magus and poet Stefan George. What was it that motivated this extraordinary aristocratic soldier, with the looks of a Hollywood idol, who was said to be the only man to stare the Fuhrer down until he averted his eyes? For Stauffenberg, the bomb plot was not a political move but a moral and spiritual necessity. After forty-two serious attempts on Hitler's life in the previous twenty years, why did he too fail? Had he succeeded, some say he would have become the de Gaulle of Germany, saviour of the nation soul. Even in failure, there can be no doubt of Stauffenberg's heroism. He stands as atonement for the Third Reich and a resolution of the conflicting myths of German culture. In this remarkable investigation, his whole life explains a troubled past to the present generation of Europeans as few have done in recent history.",en,3.66,Secret Germany,True,1227

European History,"With this heady exploration of time and space, rumors and silence, colors, tastes, and ideas, Robert Bonfil recreates the richness of Jewish life in Renaissance Italy. He also forces us to rethink conventional interpretations of the period, which feature terms like 'assimilation' and 'acculturation'. Questioning the Italians' presumed capacity for tolerance and civility, he points out that Jews were frequently uprooted and persecuted, and where stable communities did grow up, it was because the hostility of the Christian population had somehow been overcome. After the ghetto was imposed in Venice, Rome, and other Italian cities, Jewish settlement became more concentrated. Bonfil claims that the ghetto experience did more to intensify Jewish self-perception in early modern Europe than the supposed acculturation of the Renaissance. He shows how, paradoxically, ghetto living opened and transformed Jewish culture, hastening secularization and modernization. Bonfil's detailed picture reveals in the Italian Jews a sensitivity and self-awareness that took into account every aspect of the larger society.",en,3.7,Jewish Life in Renaissance Italy,True,1113

History Of The Americas,"David Lambert explores the political and cultural articulation of white creole identity in the British Caribbean colony of Barbados during the age of abolitionism (c.1780-1833), the period in which the British antislavery movement emerged, first to attack the slave trade and then the institution of chattel slavery itself. Supporters of slavery in Barbados and beyond responded with their own campaigning, resulting in a series of debates and moments of controversy, both localised and transatlantic in significance. They exposed tensions between Britain and its West Indian colonies, and raised questions about whether white slaveholders could be classed as fully 'British' and if slavery was compatible with 'English' conceptions of liberty and morality. David Lambert considers what it meant to be a white colonial subject in a place viewed as a vital and loyal part of the empire but subject to increasing metropolitan attack because of the existence of slavery.",en,,"White Creole Culture, Politics and Identity during the Age of Abolition",False,967

Emphasising the intellectual contributions of the Economistes (also known as the Physiocrats) to formulate a new colonial doctrine, the book highlights the advent of an imperial discourse of commercial liberalisation, free labour, agricultural development, and civilisation. With her careful documentation of the reciprocal impacts of economic ideas, colonial policy and practices, Roge also details key connections between Ancien Regime colonial innovation and the French Revolution's republican imperial agenda. The result is a novel perspective on the struggles to reinvent colonial empire in the final decades of the Ancien Regime and its influences on the French Revolution and beyond.",en,,"Economistes and the Reinvention of Empire : France in the Americas and Africa, c.1750-1802",False,1090

In 1971, Hillary Rodham is a young woman full of promise: Life magazine has covered her Wellesley commencement speech, she's attending Yale Law School, and she's on the forefront of student activism and the women's rights movement. And then she meets Bill Clinton. A handsome, charismatic southerner and fellow law student, Bill is already planning his political career. In each other, the two find a profound intellectual, emotional, and physical connection that neither has previously experienced. In the real world, Hillary followed Bill back to Arkansas, and he proposed several times; although she said no more than once, as we all know, she eventually accepted and became Hillary Clinton. But in Curtis Sittenfeld's powerfully imagined tour-de-force of fiction, Hillary takes a different road. Feeling doubt about the prospective marriage, she endures their devastating breakup and leaves Arkansas. Over the next four decades, she blazes her own trail--one that unfolds in public as well as in private, that involves crossing paths again (and again) with Bill Clinton, that raises questions about the tradeoffs all of us must make in building a life. Brilliantly weaving a riveting fictional tale into actual historical events, Curtis Sittenfeld delivers an uncannily astute and witty story for our times.

Lower brings to the forefront an unexplored aspect of the Holocaust."" --Washington Post In a surprising account that powerfully revises history, Wendy Lower uncovers the role of German women on the Nazi eastern front--not only as plunderers and direct witnesses, but as actual killers. Lower, drawing on twenty years of archival research and fieldwork, presents startling evidence that these women were more than ""desk murderers"" or comforters of murderous German men: they went on ""shopping sprees"" and romantic outings to the Jewish ghettos; they were present at killing-field picnics, not only providing refreshment but also shooting Jews. And Lower uncovers the stories of SS wives with children of their own whose brutality is as chilling as any in history. Hitler's Furies challenges our deepest beliefs: women can be as brutal as men, and the evidence can be hidden for seventy years. ""Disquieting . . . Earlier books about the Holocaust have offered up poster girls of brutality and atrocity . . .

History Of The Americas,"Before the LDS Church was organized, Joseph Smith received a revelation telling him that twelve men would be called as latter-day apostles. Their assignment would be to warn men and women that the end was near. Although the determination of who would fill these positions was delayed for five years, when it finally happened, God reiterated that these men were to prune the vineyard for the last time because the Second Coming was nigh. In fact, fifty six years would wind up the scene, they were told.Of the twelve men selected, nine would eventually be pruned from the vineyard themselves, to varying degrees. Seven were excommunicated, one of whom was reinstated to his position in the Twelve. Of the other six, the subjects of this book, none returned to the apostleship and four never came back to the Church at all. Those who left faded into obscurity except for when they are occasionally still mentioned in sermons as cautionary tales. But two of them made their marks in other areas of society, John Boynton becoming a successful dentist, a popular lecturer, geologist, and inventor with dozens of important patents to his name, while Lyman Johnson became a prominent attorney and business owner.

Jonathan Boulton defines the ""monarchical"" orders as those with corporate statutes which attached the presidential office to the crown of the princely founder, or made it hereditary in his house. Modelled either directly or indirectly on the fictional society of the Round Table, they incorporated varying numbers of elements borrowed from the older religious orders of knighthood and from contemporary institutions. This study explores the nature and history of thirteen orders, and reveals them as not only an ingenious supplement to (or replacement for) the feudo-vassalic ties that still bound the leading members of the nobility to their sovereign, but also as the most important institutional embodiments of the secular ideals of chivalry that were at the heart of the international court culture of the age.",en,4.0,The Knights of the Crown - The Monarchical Orders of Knighthood in Later Medieval Europe 1325-1520,True,1062

Weddle resumes the dramatic voyage of discovery and exploration in the Gulf of Mexico (the Spanish Sea) and along its coast. Combining thorough research with elegant narrative, Changing Tides treats the reader to political intrigue, tales of hurricanes and shipwrecks, and the rich historiography that marks the period between 1763 and 1803. The book opens with a series of territorial transfers that drove France from the North American continent and launched a flurry of exploration by Spain and England, each eager to survey its new territory and align its defenses. Spanish reconnaissance of the Texas barrier islands and lagoons in response to a rumored English threat and three voyages to survey and map the Gulf Coast west of the Mississippi River demonstrate international rivalry as a spur to exploration. The story concludes with Spain's retrocession of Louisiana to France and the immediate sale of the territory to the United States, a milestone toward the young nation's Manifest Destiny. Using sources previously underutilized by historians, Weddle raises new questions concerning events of the late eighteenth century and the politics that drove them, with emphasis on exploration and mapping in the Gulf.

The drama of the Great War and the Russian Revolution are juxtaposed with the spiritual dimension of the Age: the diabolism of Rasputin, the Apparition of the Virgin at Fatima, the malignancy of Lenin, the saintly courage of (the now blessed) Charles of Austria.

History Of The Americas,"""Bill Dailey, Won't You Please Come Home."" Billy Ball. The Lumber Company. Ten Acres of Roof. Homer Hankies. Bobblehead dolls. Piranhas. Twins Territory.  In 1961, the Twins brought major league baseball to the upper Midwest, becoming the first team to claim with its name not just a city but a region. In We're Gonna Win, Twins! longtime sports reporter and columnist Doug Grow chronicles a half century of Twins baseball, season by season, from the scrappy stars of Metropolitan Stadium through two World Series in the Metrodome to the opening of a new era at Target Field. Beginning each chapter with a snapshot of events in the world and in baseball, inviting fans to remember where they were when, Grow shows how teams were built and managed, from the arrival and departure of key players like Harmon Killebrew, Frank Viola, David Ortiz, and Torii Hunter to the unintended scouting trip that brought Kirby Puckett to the Twins. He profiles great players and great seasons-from the matchup of Koufax and Kaat in the 1965 World Series to the unlikely contenders of 1979 to perhaps the best World Series ever in 1991. Bringing fans behind the scenes, he shares the camaraderie and occasional scuffles in the clubhouse and tells the stories that animated even lackluster seasons, including the 1968 game when Cesar Tovar played every position. Taking us through two eras of owners, Grow captures the changing economics of baseball and vividly portrays the characters that defined the times-from the ""holy cow"" of original radio color man Halsey Hall to the sweet moments and struggles of players like Zoilo Versalles, the first Latin MVP, to the 2006 season when the major leagues' batting title, MVP, and Cy Young Award all went to Minnesota Twins. As the franchise moves back out under the open air and into its fifth decade in the major leagues, the incredible insider view and stunning photographs of We're Gonna Win, Twins! celebrate the year-in, year-out texture of the game, the oh-so-satisfying triumphs, and the angst that indelibly mark the true fan.",en,4.23,"We're Gonna Win, Twins!",True,2061
History Of The Americas,"Minneapolis's skid row, known as the Gateway district, was a lively area consisting of dozens of bars, flophouses, pawnshops, burlesque houses, charity missions, and office buildings that had aged past their prime. Encompassing some twenty-five blocks centering on the intersection of Hennepin, Washington, and Nicollet Avenues, the neighborhood was demolished between 1959 and 1963 as part of the first federally funded urban renewal project in America. Gathered here for the first time, Edwin C. Hirschoff's stark and moving images of the Gateway district's final days -- its streets, buildings, and parks, the rubble, smoke, and heavy equipment of its destruction -- eloquently capture its demise. Down and Out provides a unique historical perspective and the most extensive photographic record available of the Gateway demolition project.Joseph Hart's engaging and comprehensive essay complements Hirschoff's photographs by detailing the district's social and economic evolution and the political decision making that led to its destruction. Hart presents a popular history of Minneapolis's skid row and the people who lived there, migrant workers who learned that changes in the local economy could quickly degrade their status from valued laborer to societal menace (vagrant, tramp, or bum). By capturing the texture of life on skid row, Hart reveals the lost American culture of a bygone community.",en,4.39,Down And Out : The Life and Dealth of Minneapolis's Skid Row,True,1405

History Of The Americas,"This tale of two deep springs in Florida that began as sinkholes about 13,000 years ago and the story of the precious water they contained, reveals the recent and prehistoric story of what is now the Sunshine State and the importance of its natural resources to its people. The mineral-charged spring water sustained Florida's earliest human populations--roaming hunter-gatherers who discovered the springs about 10,000 years ago and revisited them for thousands of years--in dry times and preserved their bones and artifacts for thousands of years. These dramatic tales based on the history of Florida's first people offer new perspectives on Florida's long history. The second time-period is recent and factual. Often outrageously stranger than fiction, it follows recent events int he history of the springs - the remarkable people who dived in the deep water-filled holes and put together the picture of human life-ways 10,000 years ago at the end of the Pleistocene Era.

History Of The Americas,"In August 1944, after a brutal hedgerow campaign, the Allies broke out of Normandy and raced east toward Paris and the Seine. But Supreme Headquarters had other plans for the battle-hardened American 29th Infantry Division, which had landed at Omaha Beach on D-Day and fought fiercely for every inch of ground in Normandy. Along with the 2nd and 8th Infantry Divisions, the 29th was now ordered to turn west and seize the vital port of Brest in the far northwest corner of France. American commanders expected the operation to take a week. It would instead take almost four, as historian Joseph Balkoski recounts in this sequel to Beyond the Beachhead: The 29th Infantry Division in Normandy.          The Germans had surrounded Brest with two defensive lines of ancient French forts, concrete pillboxes, underground dugouts, trenches, and mine fields. Manning those entrenched positions was the 2nd Parachute Division, a unit of fanatical paratroopers who preferred death to surrender. In a battle marked by frontal assaults on German strongpoints and hand-to-hand combat with rifles, hand grenades, and even bayonets, the 29th Division began its crawl toward Brest with an attack on August 25 and hammered the Germans day after day at places like Keriolet, La Trinite, Hill 103, and Fort Montbarey.          Brest finally fell on September 18, 1944, at a cost to the 29th of more than 3,000 casualties. Heartbreakingly, the Allies had by then captured other ports, thus rendering Brest nearly useless and casting doubt on the decision to take it in the first place. But as Balkoski shows, the battle was more than a pointless sideshow. Even if the Allies could no longer use Brest as a port, the 29th Infantry Division had liberated a long-suffering city and killed or captured thousands of Germany's finest troops--a worthy accomplishment for any unit.",en,4.13,"From Beachhead to Brittany : The 29th Infantry Division at Brest, August-September 1944",True,1855

In 1942, Alice's mother was deported. Desperately unhappy, she resolved to learn Chopin's 24 Etudes - the most technically demanding piano pieces she knew - and the complex but beautiful music saved her sanity. A year later, she, too - together with her husband and their six-year-old son - was deported to a concentration camp. But even in Theresienstadt, music was her salvation and in the course of more than a hundred concerts she gave her fellow-prisoners hope in a world of pain and death.

History Of The Americas,"The 1970s looks at an iconic decade when the cultural left and economic right came to the fore in American society and the world at large. While many have seen the 1970s as simply a period of failures epitomized by Watergate, inflation, the oil crisis, global unrest, and disillusionment with military efforts in Vietnam, Thomas Borstelmann creates a new framework for understanding the period and its legacy. He demonstrates how the 1970s increased social inclusiveness and, at the same time, encouraged commitments to the free market and wariness of government. As a result, American culture and much of the rest of the world became more--and less--equal. Borstelmann explores how the 1970s forged the contours of contemporary America. Military, political, and economic crises undercut citizens' confidence in government. Free market enthusiasm led to lower taxes, a volunteer army, individual 401(k) retirement plans, free agency in sports, deregulated airlines, and expansions in gambling and pornography. At the same time, the movement for civil rights grew, promoting changes for women, gays, immigrants, and the disabled.

Now known as Hoboken and Jersey City, the marshy land on which Bergen was founded is just across the Hudson River from New York. At the beginning of this century, when this book was written, the Bergen region was still known for an old-fashioned charm.

Founded during the infancy of our country, and standing at the gateway of the continent, it was subjected during the colonial and revolutionary period to the privations and vicissitudes peculiar to those early days, to an unusual degree. The people inhabiting its territory, retaining to a great extent the characteristics and conservativeness of their forefathers, were oftentimes visited by their city neighbors, when tired and worn with the cares and anxieties of a business life, to secure a momentary relaxation and rest among their peaceful surroundings. Mr. Van Winkle used sources such as colonial and revolutionary documents, old newspaper articles and individual's reminiscences to compile this pleasant and enjoyable history. Chapter subjects include discovery of the region, early settlements, native inhabitants, dissatisfaction with Gov.

European History,"At a crucial point in the twentieth century, as Nazi Germany prepared for war, negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union became the last chance to halt Hitler's aggression. Incredibly, the French and British governments dallied, talks failed, and in August 1939 the Soviet Union signed a nonaggression pact with Germany. Michael Carley's gripping account of these negotiations is not a pretty story. It is about the failures of appeasement and collective security in Europe. It is about moral depravity and blindness, about villains and cowards, and about heroes who stood against the intellectual and popular tides of their time. Some died for their beliefs, others labored in obscurity and have been nearly forgotten. In 1939 they sought to make the Grand Alliance that never was between France, Britain, and the Soviet Union. This story of their efforts is background to the wartime alliance created in 1941 without France but with the United States in order to defeat a demonic enemy. 1939 is based upon Mr. Carley's longtime research on the period, including work in French, British, and newly opened Soviet archives. He challenges prevailing interpretations of the origins of World War II by situating 1939 at the end of the early cold war between the Soviet Union, France, and Britain, and by showing how anti-communism was the major cause of the failure to form an alliance against Hitler. 1939 was published on September 1, the sixtieth anniversary of the Nazi invasion of Poland and the start of the war.",en,3.57,1939 : The Alliance That Never Was and the Coming of World War II,True,1531

Named in 1881 for a bustling five-way intersection, the Five Points area became the commercial and social sector for African American churches, businesses, clubs, and homes, and the heart of Denver's black community.

History Of The Americas,"Possessing a landscape as diverse as its population, Durham County represents the changing face of North Carolina, a place and personality steeped in Southern traditions, yet redefined each passing year by new strides in technology and industry. Created in 1881, the county evolved over the decades from its humble roots as a rural Carolina railroad stop into an affluent, dynamic, and cosmopolitan community spurred on by the alternate successes of tobacco, textiles, and now, medical research. This volume, with 195 black-and-white photographs, celebrates, in word and image, the fascinating story of Durham County, tracing its history from before the county's creation through the remarkable years of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. From times characterized by a slower way of life to the accelerating modern day, Durham County allows readers a rare opportunity to step back into the past and explore the county anew, viewing its early farms, its budding downtown, the influential Hayti district (a center for black commerce), the many tobacco factories, and a selection of the numerous mills yielding a variety of products. However, this book is much more than just a portrait of Durham's commercial interests, but touches upon many elements of everyday life in the county: its personal side, covering families such as the Dukes and Bennehans; its educational opportunities, such as Duke University and North Carolina Central University; and its citizens at play, including the resurgence of Durham's famed minor-league baseball team.",en,4.5,Durham County,True,1551

History Of The Americas,"Beginning in the late 1970s, a wave of feminist organizing broke on the shores of the Twin Ports of Duluth, Minnesota, and Superior, Wisconsin. Its impact has transformed the lives of women and men in these communities and far beyond. Beginning with one of the first rape crisis programs and battered women's shelters in the nation, pioneering organizations sprang up all over Duluth and Superior to provide services and advocacy, raise awareness, and effect change on a wide range of women's issues. Making Waves presents the histories of ten innovative grassroots feminist organizations to paint an overall picture of feminist activism in the Twin Ports over the last forty years. Through the voices of the women who formed and developed them, the book tells how these organizations began, their struggles and their triumphs, their lessons and their legacies. Author Elizabeth Ann Bartlett shows that a combination of factors--the small-town community, the presence of key movers and shakers, the influence of the Anishinaabe, the proximity to Lake Superior and the northern wilderness, and a heritage of progressive organizing--all contributed to the rise and flourishing of these prominent feminist organizations in northern Minnesota and Wisconsin.",en,4.6,Making Waves : Grassroots Feminism in Duluth and Superior,True,1253
History Of The Americas,"For nearly 150 years, a great iron road has snaked its way through the Franconia community. This railroad was born in the era of the legendary railroad tycoons, and its history weaves a tale of political intrigue in the Reconstruction Era. Started in 1872, this railroad went by many names over the next century including the Alexandria and Fredericksburg Railway, the Washington Southern Railway and the company recalled fondly by many: the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad. Today the railroad is owned by CSX. Whatever its name, this railroad tied the Franconia community together, gave it a lasting identity and a doorstep to the nation. Following the Civil War, railroads around the country were entering a golden age. The world's largest railroad, the Pennsylvania Railroad, had its eye on the South. Its visionary founders, John Thomson and Thomas Scott wanted a way into the South and its markets by any means necessary, and the Alexandria and Fredericksburg Railway offered them just that chance. This hastily built railroad was held together sometimes by only a sheer force of will and a few wood planks. Phineas Barnum, founder of the Ringling Brothers Circus, even exclaimed, ""I have been all over the United States, but this is the first railroad I ever saw tied to a tree!"" Yet for its humble beginnings, the Alexandria and Fredericksburg Railway would grow over the next century into one of the most important railway corridors on the East Coast. ""The Iron Road of Franconia"" is a community-focused book that documents the many flag stops that dotted the countryside throughout the county. These stops came and went over the years, but were integral in developing Franconia's economy and future development sites. Some of the stops found were previously unknown to anyone, their foundations forgotten, left to lie in the woods.

Important advances have been made in our understanding of regional economic developments and their implications for social, cultural, and political life.  This book is intended to fill the need for an up-to-date overview of emerging regional themes and issues. Each of the sixteen chapters, written by a distinguished scholar, covers a specific chronological period and has been carefully integrated into the whole. The history begins with the evolution of Native cultures and the impact of the arrival of Europeans on those cultures, and continues to the formation of Confederation.",en,4.4,The Atlantic Region to Confederation : A History,True,1101

Instead, she began a relationship with her husband's deadliest enemy, the English baron Roger Mortimer. With the king's son and heir, the future Edward III, under their control, the pair led an invasion of England which ultimately resulted in Edward II's forced abdication in January 1327.

History Of The Americas,"The Everett Massacre (also known as Bloody Sunday) was an armed confrontation between local authorities and members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) union, commonly called ""Wobblies"". It took place in Everett, Washington on Sunday, November 5, 1916. The tragic event marked a time of rising tensions in Pacific Northwest labor history. This book is a compelling and emotionally gripping contemporary account of that tragic event. ---Excerpt--- In ten minutes of seething, roaring hell at the Everett dock on the afternoon of Sunday, November 5, 1916, there was more of the age-old superstition regarding the identity of interests between capital and labor torn from the minds of the working people of the Pacific Northwest than could have been cleared away by a thousand lecturers in a year. It is with regret that we view the untimely passing of the seven or more Fellow Workers who were foully murdered on that fateful day, but if the working class of the world can view beyond their mangled forms the hideous brutality that was the cause of their deaths, they will not have died in vain. This book is published with the hope that the tragedy at Everett may serve to set before the working class so clear a view of capitalism in all its ruthless greed that another such affair will be impossible.",en,3.4,The Everett Massacre : A History of the Class Struggle in the Lumber Industry,True,1310

At the same time, challenges to the Newtonian consensus are explored by writers such as Marius Stan and Catherine Abou-Nemeh who examine Cartesian and Leibnizian responses to the Principia.

A French cartographer first mapped the area in 1838, calling it Coteau des Prairies, -French for 'Hills of the Prairies.' On these hills sits Codington County, which got its name from the Reverend G.S. Codington, a traveling preacher based in Watertown. On August 7, 1878, Kampeska was named the first county seat. At the same time, railroad lines were extended from Minnesota into South Dakota, leading to a great influx of population known as the Great Dakota Boom. The rails only went as far as the Big Sioux River, which was east of Kampeska, so by the end of the year, the entire town up and moved to meet the railroad.

When she stumbles across the ad, she's looking for something else completely. But it seems like too good an opportunity to miss--a live-in nannying post, with a staggeringly generous salary. And when Rowan Caine arrives at Heatherbrae House, she is smitten--by the luxurious ""smart"" home fitted out with all modern conveniences, by the beautiful Scottish Highlands, and by this picture-perfect family.  What she doesn't know is that she's stepping into a nightmare--one that will end with a child dead and herself in prison awaiting trial for murder.  Writing to her lawyer from prison, she struggles to explain the events that led to her incarceration.

In Armadillos & Old Lace, the hip, witty, cosmically cryptic poet returns to once again ponder the imponderables and disentangle a mystery or two, and this time he's temporarily forsaking the mean streets of Manhattan for his old Texas stomping grounds. When Kinky Friedman decides it's time to take a break from big-city murder and mayhem, he transports himself and his cat to Texas to get back to his roots, to commune with his dad, to play with his pet armadillo, and to blow the city soot from his fevered brain. Kinky arrives at his family's combination ranch/summer camp for boys and girls to find urgent messages from Pat Knox, the local justice of the peace (who got that job by beating Kinky in what clearly had to have been a rigged election). It seems Her Honor is a tad concerned that little old ladies in the area are dropping dead at an alarming rate. Fearing something foul is afoot, she persuades Kinky to undertake some sleuthing. Undaunted by the thought of running up against the toughest lady sheriff in Texas and only a little perturbed by a mass of swarming bees, the Kinkster takes off in his talking car to put the pieces of the puzzle together. Several bunches of yellow roses and a faded photograph taken many years ago of ten pretty girls dressed in white and ready for the cotillion are just the clues Kinky needs to finally unravel a devious scheme of revenge for personal wrongs and social snobbery.

To understand his influence on the Middle East is to understand the ongoing genocidal program against the Jews of Israel. Al-Husseini was a bridge figure in terms of transporting the Nazi genocide in Europe into the post-war Middle East. As the leader of Arab Palestine during the British Mandate period, al-Husseini introduced violence against moderate Arabs as well as against Jews.

History Of The Americas,"Published in 1967, as the early triumphs of the Civil Rights movement yielded to increasing frustration and violence, The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual electrified a generation of activists and intellectuals. The product of a lifetime of struggle and reflection, Cruse's book is a singular amalgam of cultural history, passionate disputation, and deeply considered analysis of the relationship between American blacks and American society.  Reviewing black intellectual life from the Harlem Renaissance through the 1960s, Cruse discusses the legacy (and offers memorably acid-edged portraits) of figures such as Paul Robeson, Lorraine Hansberry, and James Baldwin, arguing that their work was marked by a failure to understand the specifically American character of racism in the United States. This supplies the background to Cruse's controversial critique of both integrationism and black nationalism and to his claim that black Americans will only assume a just place within American life when they develop their own distinctive centers of cultural and economic influence. For Cruse's most important accomplishment may well be his rejection of the clichés of the melting pot in favor of a vision of Americanness as an arena of necessary and vital contention, an open and ongoing struggle.",en,4.17,The Crisis Of The Negro Intellectua,True,1294

European History,"On a spring day in 1277, the prominent Jewish businesswoman Licoricia of Winchester was found murdered by her daughter, stabbed to death in her own house. Alongside Licoricia's body was that of her Christian maid, Alice. Why was Licoricia killed? And, why was her death reported as far away as Germany? Now available in paperback, this ground-breaking book draws on extensive research in the fiscal archives of medieval England - most notably those of the Jewish Exchequer - to examine the family history behind this famous murder. It is the story of Licoricia's route to wealth through advantageous marriages (her second amidst a divorce scandal which was referred to the Beth Din in Paris), her business acumen, the business contacts she made, the close relationship she appears to have had with King Henry III, and the altogether more mixed fortunes of her sons. By using Licoricia's family as an example, the book demonstrates the gradual deterioration in the conditions of even the wealthiest Jews in England in the run up to the Expulsion of 1290, as well as drawing together the fragments of a medieval life which has long fascinated historians, but has never been fully investigated. New light is also shed on the Jewish community in medieval England and the tribulations that Jews suffered of regular, punitive taxation and arbitrary imprisonments. *** Librarians: ebook available on ProQuest and EBSCO [Subject: History, Medieval Studies, Jewish Studies, British Studies, Women's Studies]",en,5.0,"Licoricia of Winchester : Marriage, Motherhood and Murder in the Medieval Anglo-Jewish Community",True,1498

Nonetheless, the existence of biblical condemnation of these rites attests to the fact that some ancient Israelites in fact did sacrifice their children.

Telephones rang off their hooks and newspaper reports buzzed as a state of euphoria swept through a small town. In 1950, LaPorte County experienced such an occasion that encompassed Hoosier hysteria in all its glory. But there is much more to this incredible untold story. The students were born into the Great Depression and grew up in the shadow of World War II. The coaches were veterans of war. A fire destroyed a school, but not its spirit.

History Of The Americas,"Deadwood, South Dakota, has been a source of American legend for over one hundred years. European exploration, Indian wars, gold booms and busts, presidential visits, frontier shootouts, and the natural beauty of the surrounding Black Hills have all captured the imagination of Americans and foreigners. Deadwood: The Golden Years recreates the town that assimilated all that its geography, gold, natural disasters, and the extremes of human behavior could throw in its way. Deadwood was a microcosm of the American frontier and the gold rush town. This history of Deadwood emphasizes its most volatile period, 1875-1925, with careful scrutiny of before and after. The author, a western historian and foremost raconteur, carefully separates legend from fact and presents them both: the spirit of Deadwood was real. Witty and sympathetic understanding born of a lifetime in the Black Hills and acquaintance with many of the characters who traipse through the pages give this book a comprehensiveness rarely found. It is a lively, reliable, and sometimes irreverent narrative of Deadwood-the next best thing to having lived there for the last century.",en,3.46,Deadwood : The Golden Years,True,1149

History Of The Americas,"A century before Oklahoma became the 46th state, Lieutenant James Wilkinson met with Osage chief Cashasegra at the confluence of the Arkansas, Grand and Verdigris rivers, later known as The Three Forks, the cradle of Oklahoma. Soon the Osage were pushed out by thousands of Cherokees relocated by the United States government to Indian Territory in Northeastern Oklahoma. A new Cherokee Nation was born. Internal strife developed first as a result of tribal disagreement over the Treaty of New Echota, followed by devastation from the American Civil War and then a period of unprecedented lawlessness. Despite the chaos the citizenry formed a democratic government, established the first school system west of the Mississippi and developed a system of laws as the economy improved until the nation was finally absorbed into what became the State of Oklahoma. 1806 describes the development of these events, relating anecdotes that involve some of the prominent personalities and describing communities and cities that merged into the early years of the 20th century.",en,3.0,1806 : Settling the Cherokee Nation,True,1066

European History,"The Polish partisan army, the largest in Europe, fought with extraordinary tenacity against the Wehrmacht during the Warsaw Uprising. This was the most famous manifestation of organized, large-scale, armed resistance to Hitler's rule. Yet the wider story of the Polish underground movement, which fought the Nazi and Soviet occupying powers, has rarely been told. As David Williamson demonstrates in this concise and authoritative new study, a reassessment of the actions, the impact and the legacy of Polish resistance is long overdue. He tells a fascinating, often tragic story. The resistance movement sprang up rapidly after the shock of defeat of 1939, and the network grew and adapted as the war progressed. It took many forms - propaganda, spying, assassination, disruption, sabotage and guerrilla warfare. Many different groups - some with conflicting aims and loyalties - were involved. There were isolated partisan bands, the Jewish resistance which fought defiantly against deportation to the death camps, and the Home Army which confronted the Germans in Warsaw with such disastrous consequences in 1944.",en,3.85,Polish Underground 1939-1947,True,1116

European History,"The German Revolution of 1918-1919 was a transformative moment in modern European history. It was both the end of the German Empire and the First World War, as well as the birth of the Weimar Republic, the short-lived democracy that preceded the establishment of the Nazi dictatorship. A time of great political drama, the Revolution saw unprecedented levels of mass mobilisation and political violence, including the 'Spartacist Uprising' of January 1919, the murders of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, and the violent suppression of strikes and the Munich Councils' Republic. Drawing upon the historiography of the French Revolution, Founding Weimar is the first study to place crowds and the politics of the streets at the heart of the Revolution's history. Carefully argued and meticulously researched, it will appeal to anyone with an interest in the relationship between violence, revolution, and state formation, as well as in the history of modern Germany.",en,3.75,Founding Weimar : Violence and the German Revolution of 1918-1919,True,968
European History,"Writing History in the Third Republic offers new insight to the historiographical output of French historians between 1860 and 1914, a period often referred to as of positivistic historians or the ecole methodique. Asserting their independence from Germanic influence by emphasising the French element in their work, historians in the period described their approach as methodical and positivistic and maintained that this was a distinctively French way of studying history. A heightened concern with sources, with facts as basis for all true knowledge, and with truth itself were unifying elements of the historiography of those historians now called ecole methodique. The ecole represented the most sophisticated theoretical considerations about history and a method for historical studies in French academia in the late nineteenth century. The purpose of this book is to reassess whether or not this school is legitimately to be seen as having emerged in the Third Republic in response to political developments of nineteenth-century France, or if the so-called methodiques share more in terms of philosophy of history and methodology than previously emphasized by scholars. This book contributes to the debate surrounding the role of history and its method, offering a counter-argument to postmodernist scholars while reassessing the contribution of twentieth-century theorists of history to the history of historiography.",en,,Writing History in the Third Republic,False,1426

As the title suggests however, it is not concerned with slavery exclusively, but with a social entity of which slavery was a significant part. Brathwaite argues that the people - from Britain and West Africa, mainly - who settled, lived and worked in Jamaica, contributed to the formation of a society which developed its own distinctive character - creole society. This society developed institutions, customs and attitudes which were basically the result of the interaction between its two main elements, the African and European. But this creole society was also part of a wider American or New World culture complex, and as such, it was also shaped by the pressures upon it of British and European mercantilism, and the American, French, and Humanitarian Revolutions.",en,4.2,Development of Creole Society in Jamaica 1770-1820,True,889

European History,"Out of the Ghetto is the compelling, true story of Jack Klajman's childhood. Jack was born in Warsaw, Poland, in 1931, as the fourth of five children, to poor, working-class Jewish parents. When Germany invaded Poland in 1939, the apartment building Jack lived in was bombed, sending his family scrambling to seek food and shelter with relatives. Then, after Poland surrendered, life became even more difficult as the Jews of Warsaw found themselves closed in by ghetto walls and being starved to death. To feed his family, Jack crept through holes in the walls to get to the Aryan side of the city, where he begged for food posing as a Christian boy. Undeterred by near-death encounters with Nazi soldiers, these smuggling efforts kept his family alive until 1942, when the Germans decided to implement the 'final solution' and transport all the Jews of the ghetto to nearby extermination camps. Jack survived by staying in the hiding places of a few leaders of the ghetto underworld, who had taken him under their wing. During the Warsaw Ghetto uprising in 1943, Jack experienced both the euphoria of Jewish resistance, and the horrors of mass murder. He survived the annihilation of the ghetto first by hiding amongst dead bodies, and later fleeing through the sewers. He ended up on the streets of Warsaw, pretending to be a Christian boy, and trying to elude the authorities whenever his true identity came under suspicion. Jack made it through the war, escaping on many occasions what seemed to be certain death. His story is a powerful and dramatic affirmation that a steely desire to survive, combined with a great deal of luck and the strength and energy of youth, can overcome even the most desperate and horrific of circumstances.",en,4.16,Out of the Ghetto,True,1741

Imagine seeing yourself not as a master of Creation, but as the most humble, dependent and vulnerable part.  Rupert Ross explores this indigenous world view and the determination of indigenous thinkers to restore it to full prominence today. He comes to understand that an appreciation of this perspective is vital to understanding the destructive forces of colonization. As a former Crown Attorney in northern Ontario, Ross witnessed many of these forces. He examines them here with a special focus on residential schools and their power to destabilize entire communities long after the last school has closed. With help from many indigenous authors, he explores their emerging conviction that healing is now better described as ""decolonization therapy."" And the key to healing, they assert, is a return to the traditional indigenous world view.  The author of two previous bestsellers on indigenous themes, Dancing with a Ghost and Returning to the Teachings, Ross shares his continuing personal journey into traditional understanding with all of the confusion, delight and exhilaration of learning to see the world in a different way.  Ross sees the beginning of a vibrant future for indigenous people across Canada as they begin to restore their own definition of a ""healthy person"" and bring that indigenous wellness into being once again. Indigenous Healing is a hopeful book, not only for indigenous people, but for all others open to accepting some of their ancient lessons about who we might choose to be.",en,4.41,Indigenous Healing : Exploring Traditional Paths,True,1705

History Of The Americas,"A riveting narrative of Wall Street buccaneering, political intrigue, and two of American history's most colossal characters, struggling for mastery in an era of social upheaval and rampant inequality. It seemed like no force in the world could slow J. P. Morgan's drive to power. In the summer of 1901, the financier was assembling his next mega-deal: Northern Securities, an enterprise that would affirm his dominance in America's most important industry-the railroads. Then, a bullet from an anarchist's gun put an end to the business-friendly presidency of William McKinley. A new chief executive bounded into office: Theodore Roosevelt. He was convinced that as big business got bigger, the government had to check the influence of the wealthiest or the country would inch ever closer to collapse. By March 1902, battle lines were drawn: the government sued Northern Securities for antitrust violations. But as the case ramped up, the coal miners' union went on strike and the anthracite pits that fueled Morgan's trains and heated the homes of Roosevelt's citizens went silent. With millions of dollars on the line, winter bearing down, and revolution in the air, it was a crisis that neither man alone could solve. Richly detailed and propulsively told, The Hour of Fate is the gripping story of a banker and a president thrown together in the crucible of national emergency even as they fought in court.

Ranging across colonial Africa, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean, Martin Thomas explores the structure of local police forces, their involvement in colonial labour control and the containment of uprisings and dissent. His work sheds new light on broader trends in the direction and intent of colonial state repression. It shows that the management of colonial economies, particularly in crisis conditions, took precedence over individual imperial powers' particular methods of rule in determining the forms and functions of colonial police actions. The politics of colonial labour thus became central to police work, with the depression years marking a watershed not only in local economic conditions but also in the breakdown of the European colonial order more generally.",en,4.33,"Violence and Colonial Order : Police, Workers and Protest in the European Colonial Empires, 1918-1940",True,957

European History,"Nearly half of the children who lived in the cities of the late Italian Renaissance were under fifteen years of age. Grinding poverty, unstable families, and the death of a parent could make caring for these young children a burden. Many were abandoned, others orphaned. At a time when political rulers fashioned themselves as the ""fathers"" of society, these cast-off children presented a very immediate challenge and opportunity.  In Bologna and Florence, government and private institutions pioneered orphanages to care for the growing number of homeless children. Nicholas Terpstra discusses the founding and management of these institutions, the procedures for placing children into them, the children's daily routine and education, and finally their departure from these homes. He explores the role of the city-state and considers why Bologna and Florence took different paths in operating the orphanages.

Essays on the politician, the soldier, the priest, the farmer, the slave, the merchant, and others together create a fresco of Roman society as it spanned 1300 years. Synthesizing a wealth of current research, The Romans surveys the most complex society ever to exist prior to the Industrial Age. Searching out the identity of the ancient Roman, the contributors describe an urbane figure at odds with his rustic peers, known for his warlike nature and his love of virtue, his magnanimity to foreigners and his predilection for cutting off his enemies' heads. Most important, perhaps, of the themes explored throughout this volume are those of freedom and slavery, of citizenship and humanitas.",en,3.45,The Romans,True,939

Analysing sources in a variety of media, including stories, maps, statuary, illustrations, architectural features, history, saints' lives, religious commentary, laws, political and social institutions, and literature, she argues that religion - so much in play again today - enabled the positing of fundamental differences among humans that created strategic essentialisms to mark off human groups and populations for racialized treatment.

This new, fifth edition adds a significant new dimension. Tarpley's documentation of a plethora of 9/11 drills may prove as revolutionary as the thesis of controlled demolition - perhaps even more so. Many people have not been able to see that 9/11 was a false flag. They may seem immune to physical facts like the free-fall speed of the towers, as they take refuge in a lack of engineering qualifications. No math skills are needed to grasp the more familiar, common-sense fact that an act that is rehearsed is also staged. Moreover, understanding how drills are essential to conduit such operations helps us recognize many types of false flags, such as the London bombings, and not only building collapses. Finally, wider public awareness of the dangers and workings of drills could help prevent terror operations, by making them too difficult to carry out with impunity.",en,3.89,9/11 Synthetic Terror : Made in USA,True,1168

Contemporary Fiction,"""A brilliantly conceived page-turner.""--Eric Schlosser, author of Fast Food Nation and Command and Control  ""I couldn't put the book down, reading most of it in the course of one increasingly intense evening. If fear of nuclear war is going to keep you up at night, at least it can be a page-turner.""--New Scientist America lost 1.4 million citizens in the North Korean attacks of March 2020. This is the final, authorized report of the government commission charged with investigating the calamity.  ""The skies over the Korean Peninsula on March 21, 2020, were clear and blue."" So begins this sobering report on the findings of the Commission on the Nuclear Attacks against the United States, established by law by Congress and President Donald J. Trump to investigate the horrific events of the next three days. An independent, bipartisan panel led by nuclear expert Jeffrey Lewis, the commission was charged with finding and reporting the relevant facts, investigating how the nuclear war began, and determining whether our government was adequately prepared for combating a nuclear adversary and safeguarding U.S. citizens. Did President Trump and his advisers understand North Korean views about nuclear weapons? Did they appreciate the dangers of provoking the country's ruler with social media posts and military exercises? Did the tragic milestones of that fateful month--North Korea's accidental shoot-down of Air Busan flight 411, the retaliatory strike by South Korea, and the tweet that triggered vastly more carnage--inevitably lead to war? Or did America's leaders have the opportunity to avert the greatest calamity in the history of our nation?  Answering these questions will not bring back the lives lost in March 2020. It will not rebuild New York, Washington, or the other cities reduced to rubble. But at the very least, it might prevent a tragedy of this magnitude from occurring again. It is this hope, more than any other, that inspired The 2020 Commission Report.",en,4.2,The 2020 Commission Report on the North Korean Nuclear Attacks Against the United States : A Speculative Novel,True,1988

Since the war ended over seventy years ago, the statistics have been a source of bitter controversy, of claim and counter-claim, as each generation of historians has struggled to uncover the truth. This contentious issue is the subject of this absorbing book. The figures reveal much about the way the war was fought, and they demonstrate the enormous human price the Soviet Union paid for its victory. That is why the statistics have been so strongly contested. Distortion and falsification by official historians have obscured the facts because the issue has been so heavily politicized.

An aging, once-glamorous Hollywood star, Constance is running in fear from something she dares not acknowledge -- and vanishes as suddenly as she appeared, leaving the narrator two macabre books: twin listings of the Tinseltown dead and soon to be dead, with Constance's name included among them. And so begins an odyssey as dark as it is wondrous, as the writer sets off in a broken-down jalopy with his irascible sidekick Crumley to sift through the ashes of a bygone Hollywood -- a graveyard of ghosts and secrets where each twisted road leads to grim shrines and shattered dreams ... and, all too often, to death.",en,3.05,Let's All Kill Constance,True,813

History Of The Americas,"The past has never been more contentious, its interpreters never more publicly at war. Now a renowned historian provides an evocative examination of his profession, American-style. Woodrow Wilson, a practicing academic historian before he took to politics, defined the importance of history: ""A nation which does not know what it was yesterday, does not know what it is today."" He, like many men of his generation, wanted to impose a version of America's founding identity: it was a land of the free and a home of the brave. But not the braves. Or the slaves. Or the disenfranchised women. So the history of Wilson's generation omitted a significant proportion of the population in favor of a perspective that was predominantly white, male and Protestant. That flaw would become a fissure and eventually a schism. A new history arose which, written in part by radicals and liberals, had  little use for the noble and the heroic, and that rankled many who wanted a celebratory rather than a critical history. To this combustible mixture of elements was added the flame of public debate. History in the 1990s was a minefield of competing passions, political views, and prejudices.",en,3.57,"Past Imperfect : Facts, Fictions, and Fraud in the Writing of American History",True,1178

The Western Empire was finally giving way under pressure from external threats, especially from Germanic tribes crossing the Rhine and Danube, as well as from seemingly ever-present internal revolts and rebellions. Ian Hughes explains how a Vandal (actually Stilicho had a Vandal father and Roman mother) came to be given almost total control of the Western Empire and describes his attempts to save both the Western Empire and even Rome itself from the attacks of Alaric the Goth and other barbarian invaders. Stilicho is one of the major figures in the history of the Late Roman Empire and his actions following the death of the emperor Theodosius the Great in 395 may have helped to permanently divide the Western and Eastern halves of the Roman Empire on a permanent basis.  Yet he is also the individual who helped maintain the integrity of the West before the rebellion of Constantine III in Britain and the crossing of the Rhine by a major force of Vandals, Sueves and Alans - both in AD 406 - set the scene for both his downfall and execution in 408 and the later disintegration of the West.Despite his role in this fascinating and crucial period of history, there is no other full-length biography of him in print.",en,4.05,Stilicho: The Vandal Who Saved Rome,True,1321

History Of The Americas,"New York Times Book Review Editors' Choice - Winner of the 2018 Truman Book Award A gripping narrative of the Truman Administration's response to the fall of Nationalist China and the triumph of Mao Zedong's Communist forces in 1949--an extraordinary political revolution that continues to shape East Asian politics to this day.   In the opening months of 1949, U.S. President Harry S. Truman found himself faced with a looming diplomatic catastrophe--""perhaps the greatest that this country has ever suffered,"" as the journalist Walter Lippmann put it. Throughout the spring and summer, Mao Zedong's Communist armies fanned out across mainland China, annihilating the rival troops of America's one-time ally Chiang Kai-shek and taking control of Beijing, Shanghai, and other major cities. As Truman and his aides--including his shrewd, ruthless secretary of state, Dean Acheson--scrambled to formulate a response, they were forced to contend not only with Mao, but also with unrelenting political enemies at home. Over the course of this tumultuous year, Mao would fashion a new revolutionary government in Beijing, laying the foundation for the creation of modern China, while Chiang Kai-shek would flee to the island sanctuary of Taiwan. These events transformed American foreign policy--leading, ultimately, to decades of friction with Communist China, a long-standing U.S. commitment to Taiwan, and the subsequent wars in Korea and Vietnam.  Drawing on Chinese and Russian sources, as well as recently declassified CIA documents, Kevin Peraino tells the story of this remarkable year through the eyes of the key players, including Mao Zedong, President Truman, Secretary of State Acheson, Minnesota congressman Walter Judd, and Madame Chiang Kai-shek, the influential first lady of the Republic of China. Today, the legacy of 1949 is more relevant than ever to the relationships between China, the United States, and the rest of the world, as Beijing asserts its claims in the South China Sea and tensions endure between Taiwan and the mainland.",en,3.94,"A Force So Swift : Mao, Truman, and the Birth of Modern China, 1949",True,2050

History Of The Americas,"Donald Trump's election to the U.S. presidency in 2016, which placed control of the government in the hands of the most racially homogenous, far-right political party in the Western world, produced shock and disbelief for liberals, progressives, and leftists globally. Yet most of the immediate analysis neglects longer-term accounting of how the United States arrived here. Race and America's Long War examines the relationship between war, politics, police power, and the changing contours of race and racism in the contemporary United States. Nikhil Pal Singh argues that the United States' pursuit of war since the September 11 terrorist attacks has reanimated a longer history of imperial statecraft that segregated and eliminated enemies both within and overseas. America's territorial expansion and Indian removals, settler in-migration and nativist restriction, and African slavery and its afterlives were formative social and political processes that drove the rise of the United States as a capitalist world power long before the onset of globalization. Spanning the course of U.S. history, these crucial essays show how the return of racism and war as seemingly permanent features of American public and political life is at the heart of our present crisis and collective disorientation.",en,4.02,Race and America's Long War,True,1298

History Of The Americas,"There are times in life when a game is more than a game; 42-0 tells the story of a time when that became true, not only for a group of young men who gathered to play football, but for two entire towns and the better part of a state. In 1967, a year after racial integration had begun in rural Tennessee, Coach Jim Graves assembled his group of players (white and black) and began an extraordinary journey that lasted for four seasons. Winning games ""one at a time"" (as almost all coaches will tell you is the only way you can), Coach Graves' Panther football team in Martin, Tennessee put up a perfect season (11-0) -- a rare-enough occurrence on its own. The next season, despite Graves' departure, a new coach came in and did the same thing. 11 wins, no losses under Coach James Dunn. A third season came along, and the results were the same; the fourth year of what finally became known as The Streak was thrilling, chilling, nerve-wracking and exciting -- for players and fans alike. The fact that this football story takes place during some of the most tumultuous times in American history provides a constant subtext to the story told here. Racial tensions were running high, especially in the South, where some white people were not too happy about integration in the schools and in public places. (Not that all black folks were necessarily happy, either!) The Vietnam War was a constant burden on the nation's resources, with thousands of American lives lost and thousands more young men who were never quite the same when they came back from war. Assassination was a word that every citizen came to know, all too well -- Martin Luther King, Jr. was shot and killed in Memphis, Tennessee (about 100 miles from where our story takes place) in 1968, followed later that year by Senator Robert Kennedy, a candidate for President. As author John Fairless asks in the book's introduction, ""The world was coming closer every day, and it felt like a dangerous place to be. With all of that going on, just how important could a field goal and a football game be?"" It was important, indeed, for the better than 10,000 citizens gathered at the local stadium on a cold November night when the ""The Streak"" was on the line and two highly-ranked teams were battling it out. Fairless writes: ""I invite you to a time that is now suspended in memory, separated from the reality of modern life and our daily grind -- yet which remains as touchable and tangible as the thins we experienced only yesterday. ""Maybe -- for some of us -- they are more real than that. Maybe -- just maybe -- a kick means more than winning or losing a game.""",en,,42-0 : The Story of Four Extraordinary Seasons,False,2626

Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Roxbury was the only point of access by land to the 800-acre peninsula called Boston. Over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Roxbury grew and evolved from a delightful country town to a bustling streetcar suburb. Roxbury became an independent city in 1846, but it was annexed to the City of Boston in 1867. During the twenty-one-year period of its independence, Roxbury began to attract many new residents who worked in its mills, factories, and breweries, as well as others who commuted to Boston for business. After its annexation, Roxbury's growth soared: streets were laid out, housing development escalated, and streetcar service to Boston and Charlestown began. Roxbury--or ""Boston Highlands"" as it was then known--was no longer home only to the descendants of its original settlers.

Over the past 150 years, the community has been home to European coal miners and Chinese laborers, railroad workers and oil-field roughnecks, cattle and sheep ranchers, business owners and entrepreneurs, and families whose roots are five generations deep. Its residents have developed a lively social life and a strong sense of identity grounded in Evanston's historic downtown and the surrounding landscape of the Bear River and the Uinta Mountains. In the 21st century, Evanston has become a regional model for historic preservation, ensuring that its past will survive into the future.",en,,Evanston,False,1030

The following is a list of the families treated: Ainsworth, Allen, Alricks, Anderson, Andrews, Awl, Ayres, Barnett, Beatty, Boas, Bomberger, Boyd, Bucher, Byers, Cowden, Craig, Crain, Curtin, Denny, Dixon, Eagley, Egle, Elder, Espy, Ferguson, Fleming, Forster, Fulton, Galbraith, Gray, Gregg, Greenawalt, Gross, Hamilton, Hays, Hoge, Keller, Kendig, Kunkel, Linn, Lobingier, Lyon, Maclay, McCormick, McNair, Muller, Murray, Neville, Orth, Parker, Roan, Robinson, Rutherford, Simonton, Stewart, Swan, Thomas, Wallace, Weir, Wiestling, Wiggins, Wilson, and Wyeth.There are 66 families included in this work, and roughly 3,000 person included in the index.",en,3.25,Pennsylvania Genealogies; Chiefly Scotch-Irish and German,True,1006

They can then use that analysis to construct answers to the big question that frames the debate and argue in support of their position.

History Of The Americas,"This is the first comprehensive study of John Thomond O'Brien, one of the most significant Irish-born figures in the history of modern South America. Born in Baltinglass, County Wicklow, in the late eighteenth-century, O'Brien emigrated to Buenos Aires in the second decade of the nineteenth century, hoping to profit from the burgeoning trade in textiles between Britain and Ireland and the River Plate. In 1813, in Buenos Aires, he enlisted as a cavalry officer in the armies fighting against Spanish rule. His actions on the battlefield, which contributed to the achievement of independence in Argentina, Chile, Peru and Uruguay, and his close acquaintance with the two most famous generals of the war, Jose de San Martin and Simon Bolivar, brought him renown in South America and Europe. O'Brien criss-crossed South America during his colourful post-war career, spending time in Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Brazil and Uruguay. In the 1820s, he promoted Irish emigration to Argentina, launched the highest sailing ship in the world on Lake Titicaca and led the campaign of support for O'Connell and Catholic Emancipation among the Irish in Buenos Aires. In the 1830s, he explored the Amazon for gold and was imprisoned in Buenos Aires by the dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas. In the 1840s, he represented the Montevidean government in London and Paris. During the last decade of his life, before his death in 1861, he campaigned to have monuments erected across South America to the leaders of the independence campaign. O'Brien's compelling story mirrors that of a tumultuous period in Irish and South American history.",en,,Don Juan O'Brien : An Irish Adventurer in Nineteenth-Century South America,False,1625

Under judicial torture and imprisonment, the men confessed and were condemned to death; their womenfolk, who had been kept under house arrest with their children, denounced the men under torture and eventually converted to Christianity. A papal hearing in Rome about possible judicial misconduct in Trent made the trial widely known and led to a wave of anti-Jewish propaganda and other accusations of ritual murder against the Jews.",en,3.66,Trent 1475 : Stories of a Ritual Murder Trial,True,777

History Of The Americas,"Fort Niagara is located twelve miles downriver from the world-renowned Niagara Falls, yet few visitors to either site know this was once Iroquois territory and claimed by France. This volume summarizes the fascinating span of North American history when New France was established during the sixteenth century in present-day Canada, explored, and expanded to the Niagara River - a strategic water and portage route connected to the Great Lakes. Chronologically the authors dramatically trace how the Iroquois gained the Niagara River, and how they kept this lucrative trade route for themselves long after the French became established fur traders in the Great Lakes. The Iroquois continued to control the Niagara River as the French built the short-lived Forts Conti (1669), Denonville (1687/1688), and finally Fort Niagara (1726-1759). Fort Niagara: The Key to the Inland Oceans and the French Movement to Dominate North America incorporates actions and political changes elsewhere that influenced the French and Iroquois at Niagara, especially during the French and Indian War, which ended the French Occupation of Fort Niagara and set the stage for the Iroquois to lose their long-held Niagara River territory.",en,3.0,Fort Niagara : The Key to the Inland Oceans and the French Movement to Dominate North America,True,1214

History Of The Americas,"*This is the LARGE PRINT VERSION which contains a new Introduction and Afterword with new information about the original author including newspaper articles, census data, death certificates, and more. The First Book Ever Written on William H. Bonney who died at about 12:30am July 15, 1881. In the early 1950's at the Library of Congress, Jeffrey C. Dykes discovered a copyright application for the title The True Life of Billy the Kid which was recorded September 7, 1881―less than two months after the Kid's demise. However, a copy of the actual publication could not be found. Later, Ramon Adams, following up on Dykes's information was able to locate an original copy at the Boston Anthenaeum which was bound together with some religious pamphlets. A photostat copy of it can now be viewed at the Denver Public Library, as well. The story was originally published as Billy the Kid, the New Mexican Outlaw; or, The Bold Bandit of the West. Signed, The Publisher 2019 ** ""Billy the Kid"" has been written up for eastern journals in all sorts of styles. He has been given an impregnable castle, elegant clothes, fine manners and great generosity. In short the accounts of him have been made up of whole cloth, and if eastern people credit them they have about as good an idea of what Billy really was, as a burro has of the beauties of Milton. Whatever merit this volume may possess, attaches, in the estimation of its author, altogether to the accuracy of the incidents narrated and the correctness of the details connected with the career of ""Billy the Kid."" There has been no necessity to draw upon a vivid imagination to enhance its interest, for without any of the blazonry of humbug or the embroidery of fiction, the true story of ""Billy the Kid"" eclipses any border romance, and dims by comparison the tales woven from the realms of fiction. It deals with the characters and events which are matters of State history with the people of New Mexico to-day, and aims to give, in a connected form, the events in the life of an outlaw who was the very incarnation of border civilization, at a period when it was the civilization of the knife and the rifle, with the number of their victims cut on the stock; of savage Indian raids and massacres; of ruthless vendettas and assassinations; of wars among stock kings and cattle thieves, and of lawlessness in every form. If, in its recital, the ""The True History of Billy the Kid"" has been made interesting enough to please the public, no one has more reason to be grateful than author. -Edmund Fable Jr. 1881",en,,The True Life of Billy the Kid : The Noted New Mexican Outlaw or the Bold Bandit of the West (Annotated),False,2558

History Of The Americas,"The definitive true story of Wild Bill, the first lawman of the Wild West, by the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Dodge City. In July 1865, Wild Bill Hickok shot and killed Davis Tutt in Springfield, MO--the first quick-draw duel on the frontier. Thus began the reputation that made him a marked man to every gunslinger in the Wild West. James Butler Hickock was known across the frontier as a soldier, Union spy, scout, lawman, gunfighter, gambler, showman, and actor. He crossed paths with General Custer and Buffalo Bill Cody, as well as Ben Thompson and other young toughs gunning for the sheriff with the quickest draw west of the Mississippi. Wild Bill also fell in love--multiple times--before marrying the true love of his life, Agnes Lake, the impresario of a traveling circus. He would be buried however, next to fabled frontierswoman Calamity Jane. Even before his death, Wild Bill became a legend, with fiction sometimes supplanting fact in the stories that surfaced. Once, in a bar in Nebraska, he was confronted by four men, three of whom he killed in the ensuing gunfight. A famous Harper's Magazine article credited Hickok with slaying 10 men that day; by the 1870s, his career-long kill count was up to 100. The legend of Wild Bill has only grown since his death in 1876, when cowardly Jack McCall famously put a bullet through the back of his head during a card game. Bestselling author Tom Clavin has sifted through years of western lore to bring Hickock fully to life in this rip-roaring, spellbinding true story.",en,3.83,Wild Bill : The True Story of the American Frontier's First Gunfighter,True,1541
Reference Works,"Family Gorham Plausible Speculations is an historical genealogical record of the Family Gorham, which includes a lineage of emperors, nobles, crusaders and clergy from early medieval times to everyday people in contemporary North America. It begins in mid-eighth-century France with Charlemagne through his daughter Rotrude. From there, the story tracks thirty-six generations, all the way to the author's son Trevor, living in twenty-first-century Canada. Along the way, the reader is treated to tales of medieval nobility and the evolution of the Family Gorham name in northwestern France in Brittany, Maine and Normandy until the eleventh-century migration to Leicester, Hertford, and Northampton, England. The book recounts events in contemporary chronicles because nobility records are fragmentary and rarely place them in their family context. Mainly, they were documented on grants and charters to religious houses of the day.",en,,Family Gorham Plausible Speculations,False,933

DeLucia grounds her study of one of the most devastating conflicts between Native Americans and European settlers in early America in five specific places that were directly affected by the crisis, spanning the Northeast as well as the Atlantic world. She examines the war's effects on the everyday lives and collective mentalities of the region's diverse Native and Euro-American communities over the course of several centuries, focusing on persistent struggles over land and water, sovereignty, resistance, cultural memory, and intercultural interactions. An enlightening work that draws from oral traditions, archival traces, material and visual culture, archaeology, literature, and environmental studies, this study reassesses the nature and enduring legacies of a watershed historical event.",en,,Memory Lands : King Philip's War and the Place of Violence in the Northeast,False,1088

History Of The Americas,"This collection focuses on the period from 1763 through the mid-nineteenth century. In Louisiana and the Floridas, the territorial ambitions of Britain, France, and Spain, as well as the new American Republic, led to a rapidly shifting series of political and cultural changes. The result in the region was the creation of complex hybrids of social mores, customs, and legal ideas and institutions. Of particular significance were the land claims that inevitably followed transfers of sovereignty and legal systems, the social and legal entrenchment of established elites and the institution of slavery, as well as a legacy of extra-legal violence and folk justice. The fluid borders of Louisiana and the Floridas, both East and West, exposed the flexible social identities and political loyalties of those who were settled there. Indeed, later accounts of the period and place have often misunderstood mixed motives, and contemporary rhetoric, of its subjects and citizens. Through a mix of different historiographical methods, a broad understanding of legal and social history, and the lens of plural comparative contexts, this collection tells us much about continuity and change in a critical transition period for the region, as well as for the modern Western nation-state and its increasingly common laws. xxxv, 297 pp. 10 illustrations.

History Of The Americas,"This stunning, fully illustrated history of the Georgia Capitol not only pays tribute to a grand old edifice but also vividly recounts the history that was made - and that continues to be made - within and without its walls. The Georgia Capitol is a place where, for more than a century, legislators have debated, governors have proclaimed, and courts have ruled. It is also a place where countless ordinary citizens have gathered in lively tour groups, angry protest mobs, and at times solemn funeral processions. As Timothy J. Crimmins and Anne H. Farrisee move through the major periods in the Capitol's history, they tell three interwoven stories. One is a tale of the building itself, its predecessors, its design and construction, its occasionally ill-considered renovations, and the magnificent, decade-long restoration begun in 1996. Also revealed is how the gradual accumulation of statues, flags, portraits, and civic rituals and pageants has added new layers of meaning to an already symbolic structure. The third story the authors tell is of the legislative and judicial battles that sought to limit or extend democratic freedoms. Some of these events were high drama: fisticuffs during a prohibition debate, Eugene Talmadge's strong-arm eviction of the state treasurer from the statehouse, the Three Governors Controversy, and an African American protest in the segregated cafeteria. From the laying of the cornerstone in 1885 to the present, successive generations of Georgians have created a distinctive history in and around the Capitol as they have exercised, or sought to gain, their rights. Today the Georgia Capitol remains a working center of state government, and its history continues to unfold.",en,4.75,Democracy Restored : A History of the Georgia State Capitol,True,1718

History Of The Americas,"The Wall and the Garden  was first published in 1968. Minnesota Archive Editions uses digital technology to make long-unavailable books once again accessible, and are published unaltered from the original University of Minnesota Press editions.The election day sermon in colonial New England was an annual, formal address by a minister of the gospel to the newly assembled legislature of the colony. The tradition began in the Massachusetts Bay colony in 1634, and it continued, in Boston, for 250 years. In this volume, Professor Plumstead presents a collection of nine of the Massachusetts election sermons, chosen from among the surviving Massachusetts sermons which were printed between 1661 and 1775. They are not chosen as representative but, rather, as the best, judged on a basis of literary excellence and ideas and points of style relevant to later developments in American literature and history. There are changes in style and theme in the 105 years between the first and the last selection, and, in his brief introduction to each of the sermons, the editor discusses these changes and the sermon's relationship to the tradition as a whole.In a general introduction, Professor Plumstead provides background information about the history and significance of the election sermons. As he makes clear, the election sermon tradition offers a vantage point for seeing both continuity and change in colonial intellectual history. The sermons in this collection will complement colonial studies by bringing the reader close to the spirit of the times.The title of the volume, The Wall and the Garden, derives from the frequent use by colonial preachers of the metaphors of the garden and the wall to describe the colonies and their spiritual enemies.",en,,"The Wall and the Garden : Selected Massachusetts Election Sermons, 1670-1775",False,1754

The centennial of the United States was celebrated with great fanfare--fireworks, exhibitions, pious calls to patriotism, and perhaps the most underhanded political machination in the country's history: the theft of the presidency from Samuel Tilden in favor of Rutherford B. Hayes. This was the Gilded Age, when robber barons held the purse strings of the nation, and the party in power was determined to stay in power.

Although most of these accounts appeared before the Civil War, more than one-third are the result of the ambitious efforts of the Federal Writers' Project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) to interview surviving ex-slaves during the 1930s. The result of these efforts was the Slave Narrative Collection--a group of autobiographical accounts of former slaves that today stands as one of the most enduring and noteworthy achievements of the WPA. Compiled in seventeen states during the years 1936-38, the collection consists of more than two thousand interviews with former slaves, most of them first-person accounts of slave life and the respondents' own reactions to bondage. The interviews afforded aged ex-slaves an unparalleled opportunity to give their personal accounts of life under the ""peculiar institution,"" to describe in their own words what it felt like to be a slave in the United States. --Norman R.

His travels, his five marriages, his public faux pas, and his flamboyant campaigns provided years of amusement for his constituents. This political biography rescues Reynolds from his cartoon-character reputation, however, by explaining his political appeal and highlighting his genuine contributions without overlooking his flaws. Julian Pleasants argues that Reynolds must be understood in the context of Depression-era North Carolina. He capitalized on the discontent of the poverty-stricken lower class by campaigning in tattered clothes while driving a ramshackle Model T--a sharp contrast to his wealthy, chauffeur-driven opponent, incumbent senator Cam Morrison. In office, Reynolds supported Roosevelt's New Deal. Although he was not pro-Nazi, his isolationist stance and his association with virulent right-wingers enraged his constituents and ultimately led to his withdrawal from politics. Pleasants reveals Reynolds to be a showman of the first order, a skilled practitioner of class politics, and a unique southern politician--the only one who favored the New Deal while advocating isolationist views. |A biography of U.S. senator, Robert Rice Reynolds of North Carolina, whose controversial political career between 1933-1945 was marked by unconventional campaign tactics, far-right associations, and a colorful personal life.",en,3.75,Buncombe Bob : The Life and Times of Robert Rice Reynolds,True,1489

Very few copies were ever printed, and those few copies were in French.The seventh in a series on the early Olympics, this work fills a gap in the recording of early Olympics history by providing complete results for all competitors and all events (except for shooting, which has only partial information due to the obscurity of the results). In virtually all cases, a 1920 source has been used in preference to a more modern source of information, and all details have been fully researched in contemporary newspapers, journals, and magazines and checked for accuracy by experts on various sports from all over the world.The appendices include a schedule of events and festivities for the 1920 Olympics, information on World War I and Olympians, a tentative schedule of events that had been planned for the 1916 Olympic Games (which never took place because of the war), and information on the 1919 Inter-Allied Games.",en,4.0,"The 1920 Olympic Games : Results for All Competitors in All Events, with Commentary",True,1297

Reference Works,"Robert A. Slade, after collecting old fishing tackle since 1958 and contributing articles on old fishing lures for a collector magazine for several years started researching and writing books in the 1990's. He published the HISTORY & COLLECTIBLE FISHING TACKLE OF WISCONSIN in 1999 which sold 4,500 copies. Bob realized that even though there have been many books published on the subject of old fishing lures that few books covered any detailed history on the old lure makers. His latest book writing project was nine years in the making and covers over 100 years of lure making history starting in 1875 and covers over 2,500 lures makers throughout all of North America. THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF OLD FISHING LURES MADE IN NORTH AMERICA is the first publication with extensive history and patent information on old lure makers and the first to include extensive coverage on Canadian lure makers. The author traveled to 11 states and 3 Candian Providences visting collectors homes, newspaper archives, museums and other sources and has taken over 10,000 pictures in preparing the historical stories for these books. The set of books arranges for the individual and company lures makers to appear in alphabetical order. People purchasing these books can buy any one single book, a whole set, or even a book a month if they desire as the books will be printed and shipped on demand. Each book has over 400 pages of text, pictures and collector values with each book containing a table of contents and index as well as a master index for the complete set of books.",en,,The Encyclopedia of Old Fishing Lures : Made In North America,False,1556
